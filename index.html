McGahern has long been recognized as a contemporary master of the short story; <b>The Collected Stories</b> confirms his reputation as Ireland's leading prose writer.</p><p>John McGahern was born in Dublin in 1934 and brought up in the West of Ireland. He was a graduate of University College, Dublin. He worked as a Primary School teacher and held various academic posts at universities in Britain, Ireland and America. In the opinion of the <i>Observer</i>, John McGahern was 'Ireland's greatest living novelist'. He was the author of six highly acclaimed novels and four collections of short stories, and was the recipient of numerous awards and honours, including a Society of Authors Travelling Scholarship, the American-Irish Award, the Prix Etrang�re Ecureuil and the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. <b>Amongst Women</b>, which won both the GPA and the <i>Irish Times</i> Award, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and made into a four-part BBC television series. His work has appeared in anthologies and has been translated into many languages. His last book, Memoir, was published in 2005.</p><h2>The Austro-Hungarian Forces in World War I (1): 1914&#x2013;16 (Men-at-Arms)</h2><p>The part played in World War I (1914-1918) by the army of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy is little known to English-speakers, perhaps because the end of the war saw the complete destruction of the Empire. Yet it was of central importance, providing nearly all Central Powers forces on the Italian front, huge numbers on the Russian front, seven Army Corps in the Balkans &#x2013; and even a little-known contingent in Turkey and Palestine. The first half of the story of this complex multi-national organization at war is described here in a concise but detailed text, supported by data tables and an insignia chart, and illustrated with rare photographs and colourful uniform plates.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Dr Peter Jung was born in 1955 and attended the University of Vienna where he obtained a Doctorate in History. He started working for the Austrian State Archives/War Archives in 1981 and was the head of three departments there. He has written a number of books and articles including Die Feldverwendung der �sterreichisch - Ungarischen Gendarmerie 1914/18 and L&#39;ultimo Guerra degli Asburgo, Carso-Basso Isonzo-Trieste. Sadly Peter passed away in April 2003.</p><h2>Princess Margaret: A Life of Contrasts (Y)</h2><p><b>The fascinating biography of one of the most controversial royal figures of the twentieth century and its first celebrity: Princess Margaret. </b><br> &nbsp;<br> As a pre-war royal whose world was hugely circumscribed by the strictures of another age, Princess Margaret was admired as well as vilified for most of her adult life. She helped usher the monarchy into the modern world&#x2014;which sometimes led to conflict and misunderstanding in both her private and public life. Christopher Warwick&#x2019;s superbly researched biography redresses the balance. It gives the full, insider story of the Princess&#x2019;s many love affairs, but also looks at her tireless work for charity and willingness to break taboos&#x2014;it was she, not Diana, who first championed HIV and AIDS awareness. <i>Princess Margaret </i>reminds us that its subject was one of the most remarkable, if complex and contradictory, modern royal personalities.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><i>Reissue.</i></p><p>Christopher Warwick is the author of several bestselling royal biographies. He has written widely for newspapers and magazines, and frequently appears on television and radio.<b>Praise for <i>Princess Margaret</i></b>:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I read such a sensitive, insightful, provocative biography. Masterful.&#x201d; &#x2014;Adrian Tinniswood, OBE, writer and historian<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thoroughly researched and well-written . . . provides a fascinating insight into Princess Margaret&#x2019;s character and troubled life.

J. Parker now writes and makes things out of wood and metal."I have reviewed books before that I thought might someday be found to have achieved greatness.... But I am trying to be precise in my use of the word when I tell you that K.J. Parker is writing work after work that demands to be placed in that category. "&#x2015;<b><i>Orson Scott Card on The Engineer trilogy</i></b><br><br>"This is grown-up fantasy blessed with humour, intelligence and... panache. A bravura display of intricate storytelling and artfully-doled-out revelations."&#x2015;<b><i><i>SFX</i></i></b><br><br>"When so many fantasy sagas are tired, warmed-over affairs, a writer like K.J. Parker is more of a hurricane than a breath of fresh air."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Dreamwatch</i></i></b></p><h2>One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945 (The Global Century Series)</h2><p><p><strong>"A magisterial account of our time by a distinguished historian."&#x2015;Walter LaFeber, prize-winning author of <em>The Clash</em></strong></p> Global change has accelerated at an unprecedented pace in the last half-century. The trajectory of change points in different directions, with the world growing at once more interconnected and more fragmented. Commerce and migrations, television and the World Wide Web suggest a story of growing interconnection, while at the same time the proliferation of nation-states and the divisions rooted in religion, race, and material inequality tell of separation and conflict. David Reynolds&#x2019;s brilliant history captures both themes and grounds them vividly in the people and events of the last fifty years. Reynolds captures the great political events: the Cold War, the Chinese revolution, independence movements, Vietnam, and the fall of the Soviet Union, and broader developments: economic and population growth, the spread of cities, vast technological change, genetic manipulation, and the creation of a digital world. Carefully avoiding an encyclopedic approach, Reynolds integrates these themes into a narrative with authority, vision, and style. A volume in the Global Century series, books by outstanding scholars on the history of the world in the twentieth century&#x2015;general editor, Paul Kennedy. Illustrated, maps</p><p><i>"Writing a global history of the second half of this century is, of course, an impossible task."</i><p> You've got to give Cambridge fellow David Reynolds credit for such frankness, but it certainly didn't stop him from setting out to accomplish the impossible. Thankfully, Reynolds succeeds brilliantly, as becomes quickly clear from this marvelous, unbelievably readable 860-page survey, roughly bookended by the Berlin blockade and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The project is impossible, "of course," thanks to the subject's staggering size and complexity, but Reynolds takes this in stride, admits his limitations, and digs into a robust, good-spirited, and even-handed analysis, intimidating as a whole but approachable and engaging in its parts.</p><p> <i>One World Divisible</i> does tackle it all--the political, social, and cultural changes of an era that witnessed ever-increasing unity, interconnectedness, and globalization. All the usual suspects--the cold war, the decolonization of Africa and Asia, the rebirth of post-war Germany and Japan--get predictably thorough treatment, but Reynolds also takes on the "feminist earthquake" of women's lib and the pill, examines how advances in electronics and genetics far outweighed the impact of exploiting the atom, and even tracks the global spread of "Coca-colonization" and rock &amp; roll. Through it all, Reynolds's readable voice and thoughtful organization keep you reading; discrete, intuitive chapters such as "Israel, Oil, and Islam," "Color, Creed, and Coups," and "Chips and Genes" give you just enough to chew on along the way. A fine beginning to W.W. Norton's ambitious Global Century series. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>David Reynolds is a professor of international history at Cambridge University. He is the author of books including The Long Shadow and In Command of History: Churchill Fighting and Writing the Second World War, which won the Wolfson Prize.</p><h2>The Secret History: A Novel of Empress Theodora</h2><p><b>Where Theodora went, trouble followed....</b><br>&nbsp;<br><i>In sixth-century</i> <i>Constantinople, one woman, Theodora, defied every convention and all the odds and rose from common theater tart to empress of a great kingdom, the most powerful woman the Roman Empire would ever know.&nbsp;The woman whose image was later immortalized in glittering mosaic was a scrappy, clever, conniving, flesh-and-blood woman full of sensuality and spirit whose real story is as surprising as any ever told</i>....<br>&nbsp;<br>After her father dies suddenly, Theodora and her sisters face starvation and a life on the streets.

For those with eyes to see it, this secret can be life-changing. It is so simple that it hides in plain sight, seen yet unseen every day. <br><br> Writing with the characteristic precision and vividness that has made him one of the greatest inspirational authors of the past century, Robert Collier reveals this secret in his little-known classic, <i>The Life Magnet</i>. <br><br> What is this great secret? Simply this: The images that you impress upon your subconscious mind-whether of abundance or lack, failure or success-outpicture the surrounding world in startling and unexpected ways. <br><br> In <i>The Life Magnet</i>, Collier shows how to overcome mental obstacles and use this hidden power-which he variously calls the Divine Mind, the subconscious mind, the "Genii-of-your-Mind," and the "Open Sesame of life." Whatever the name, Collier illustrates how it works, why it works, how to summon it, and how to control it for higher good in your life.</p><p>Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1885, Robert Collier trained to become a priest early in his life, before settling on a career in business, achieving success in the fields of advertising, publishing, and engineering. After recovering from a chronic illness with the help of mental healing, Collier began studying New Thought, metaphysical, and success principles. He distilled these principles into a popular and influential pamphlet series, <i>The Secret of the Ages</i>, in 1926. He began issuing a second pamphlet series called <i>The Secret of Gold</i> in 1927 and completed it the following year under the title <i>The Life Magnet</i>. He died in 1950.</p><h2>New Way of Seeing: The History of Art in 57 Works</h2><p><p><strong>An exciting new critical voice explores what it is that makes great art great through an illuminating analysis of the world&#x2019;s artistic masterpieces.</strong></p><p>From a carved mammoth tusk (ca. 40,000 BCE) to Bosch&#x2019;s <em>Garden of Earthly Delights</em> (1505&#x2013;1510) to Duchamp&#x2019;s <em>Fountain</em> (1917), a remarkable lexicon of astonishing imagery has imprinted itself onto the cultural consciousness of the past 40,000 years.</p><p>Author Kelly Grovier devotes himself to illuminating these and more than fifty other seminal works in this radical new history of art. Stepping away from biography, style, and the chronology of &#x201c;isms&#x201d; that preoccupies most of art history, <em>A New Way of Seeing</em> invites a new interaction with art, one in which we learn <em>from</em> the artworks and not just about them. Grovier identifies that part of the artwork that bridges the divide between art and life and elevates its value beyond the visual to the vital. This book challenges the sensibility that conceives of artists as brands and the works they create as nothing more than material commodities to hoard, hide, and flip for profit.</p><p>Lavishly illustrated with many of the most breathtaking and enduring artworks ever created, Kelly Grovier casts fresh light on these famous works by daring to isolate a single, and often overlooked, detail responsible for its greatness and power to move.</p> 200 color illustrations</p><p>Kelly Grovier is a poet, historian, and cultural critic. He is a regular contributor on art to the Times Literary Supplement, and his writing has appeared in numerous publications, including the Observer, Sunday Times, and Wired. Educated at the University of California, Los Angeles, and at the University of Oxford, he is the author of 100 Works of Art That Will Define Our Age and Art Since 1989.&#x201c;Finally, a book that asks, with a restless and sensitive eye, what it is that makes masterpieces sing across the centuries. A highly enjoyable history of art that is also a fascinating mediation on excellence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jonathan Jones, art critic, <em>The Guardian</em></strong></p><h2>An Aesthetic Education in the Era of Globalization</h2><p><p>During the past twenty years, the world&#x2019;s most renowned critical theorist&#x2015;the scholar who defined the field of postcolonial studies&#x2015;has experienced a radical reorientation in her thinking. Finding the neat polarities of tradition and modernity, colonial and postcolonial, no longer sufficient for interpreting the globalized present, she turns elsewhere to make her central argument: that aesthetic education is the last available instrument for implementing global justice and democracy.</p><p>Spivak&#x2019;s unwillingness to sacrifice the ethical in the name of the aesthetic, or to sacrifice the aesthetic in grappling with the political, makes her task formidable. As she wrestles with these fraught relationships, she rewrites Friedrich Schiller&#x2019;s concept of play as double bind, reading Gregory Bateson with Gramsci as she negotiates Immanuel Kant, while in dialogue with her teacher Paul de Man. Among the concerns Spivak addresses is this: Are we ready to forfeit the wealth of the world&#x2019;s languages in the name of global communication? &#x201c;Even a good globalization (the failed dream of socialism) requires the uniformity which the diversity of mother-tongues must challenge,&#x201d; Spivak writes. &#x201c;The tower of Babel is our refuge.&#x201d;</p><p>In essays on theory, translation, Marxism, gender, and world literature, and on writers such as Assia Djebar, J. M. Coetzee, and Rabindranath Tagore, Spivak argues for the social urgency of the humanities and renews the case for literary studies, imprisoned in the corporate university. &#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;the literary can still do something.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak is University Professor at Columbia University and a trainer of elementary school teachers in West Bengal.&#x201c;Spivak remains an indispensable leader and guide in the exhilarating conceptual adventure&#x2015;the trip&#x2015;which, since the late sixties, we've called theory. <i>Aesthetic Education</i> presents us with lessons that she has learnt on the way&#x2015;difficult, defiant, sober lessons for these unpromising times. They demand our attention.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Simon During, University of Queensland</b><br><br>&#x201c;This captivating collection of lectures delivered over the course of a quarter century asks us to attend to the profoundly democratic possibilities of the imagination. Aesthetic education empowers us to apprehend and negotiate what Spivak calls the "double bind at the heart of democracy." At a time when the humanities are expected to genuflect before the sciences and privatization and professionalization displace knowledge, Spivak urges us not only to stand tall but to insist that ethical solidarities are only possible through the rigorous training of the imagination.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Angela Y. Davis, University of California, Santa Cruz</b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] rewarding series of meditations on the possibility of reading, learning, and teaching that would encourage the full flowering of cultural, sexual, and linguistic diversity and resist the homogenizing force of globalization...The gathered texts are a testament to a fundamental faith in the power of literature that is never less than inspiring.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's latest collection of essays offers a timely reminder of what the real and powerful ends of education might be...[The essays] cover the breadth of an extraordinary intellectual career...The essays, for all their diversity, have the quality of a cumulative, long retrospection, a slow-burning consideration of what it means to teach, how faultily we do it and how we might do better by those who most want to learn and have least opportunity...It is, though, Spivak's assertion, after Schiller, that an aesthetic education remains the strongest resource available for the cause of global justice and democracy. The homogenizing and pacifying effects of globalization, which Spivak so routinely lambasts, here, she argues, can never extend "to the sensory equipment of the experiencing being." And here she has never sounded more persuasive, identifying in arts education the evocation of a phenomenology at feeling and the engendering of critical thinking that are posited beyond the logic of capital.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Shahidha Bari</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b></p><h2>The Refuge: A Maxie and Stretch Mystery</h2><p>Maxie McNabb and her miniature dachshund, Stretch, are in Hawaii to help Maxie&#39;s friend Karen Bailey pack up her house.

Or maybe it was the other way around.<br> <br>This was the mid-1970s, and I was an undergraduate at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. When I wasn&#x2019;t working at a research lab in the Psychology Department, I spent my time hanging out at the student-run FM radio station, WPGU, where I was the nighttime disc jockey. Spinning records requires more than mere technique, and this was especially true back in the pre-digital, vinyl days. It&#x2019;s an art that involves both intuition and expertise, and it took me quite a few on-air mishaps before I finally felt relaxed in my soundproof, windowed box at the station. To drop a new song in properly, you have to match its rhythm and even its musical key with those of the song you&#x2019;re fading out. Like two people meeting in the doorway of a restaurant as one leaves while the other arrives, the two songs overlap for several seconds, and this creates a pleasing sense of continuity. One of the things I loved most about Led Zeppelin was how the often strange and drawn-out ends to their songs spurred me to be more creative in the transitions I engineered. As &#x201c;Ramble On&#x201d; drifted away with Robert Plant&#x2019;s &#x201c;Mah baby, mah baby, mah baby&#x201d; growing softer and softer, I would overlay the thunder and rain that opens the Doors&#x2019; &#x201c;Riders on the Storm.&#x201d;<br> <br>As a midwestern kid who was just beginning to figure out what he wanted to do with his life, I was drawn to psychology because it promised a future of explanations: why humans did what they did, both good and bad; what the components of our minds were that determined our thoughts and feelings; and, most intriguing of all, how we might use this deepening well of knowledge to reshape ourselves and our world. In contrast, the reason I was so obsessed with music was that it defied explanation. Why did I like the bands that I did? Why did some songs make the hair on my arms stand up or cause me to involuntarily bounce, while others provoked absolute indifference? Why did music have such a powerful effect on my emotions? It spoke to some hidden reservoir of myself that I didn&#x2019;t understand, but which clearly existed and was important. In 1978, after I moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to work on my PhD, my advisor, Robert Zajonc, would call me into his office, hold up two museum postcards with modern art paintings on them, then ask me which one I liked better. He did this for maybe four or five sets of paintings. Each time I knew right away which one I liked more, but I always fumbled for the reasons why.<br> <br>Bob smiled and nodded at my discomfort. &#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Psychologists were starting to realize that there were hidden, underlying mechanisms that guided or even created our thoughts and actions, but we were only just beginning to understand what they were and how they worked. In other words, an important part of what makes us who we are was still beyond explanation, yet it was the source of a key part of our experience.<br> <br>Around this same time, in the late 1970s, a man named Michael Gazzaniga was driving around New England in a twenty-six-foot GMC motor home. One of the fathers of modern neuroscience, Gazzaniga wasn&#x2019;t just taking a road trip for fun. The purpose of his travels was to visit &#x201c;split-brain&#x201d; patients&#x2014;people who&#x2019;d had their corpus callosum, the band of fibers linking the right and left hemispheres of the brain, severed in order to reduce epileptic seizures. Gazzaniga hoped to learn new things about how different regions of the brain interacted. He would pull up in his motor home and seat the patient in front of a visual display that could present some stimuli to his right brain hemisphere and other information to his left hemisphere. Typically the patient was not aware of what was presented to the right side of his or her brain, only what was presented to the left side. In some studies, the researchers would present visual commands such as &#x201c;walk&#x201d; to the right brain hemisphere, and the patient would immediately push his chair back from the computer table and start to leave the testing room. Asked where he was going, he&#x2019;d say something like &#x201c;Going to my house to get a soda.&#x201d; The explanations sounded reasonable but were completely wrong. Gazzaniga was struck by how quickly and easily his patients were able to interpret and give reasonable explanations for behaviors they did not consciously intend or initiate on their own.<br> <br>The breakthrough insight that Gazzaniga took away from his experiments was that the impulses that drive many of our daily, moment-to-moment behaviors originate in brain processes that are outside of our awareness, even if we are quick to understand them otherwise. We all feel the subjective experience of will, but this feeling is not valid evidence of having willed ourselves to behave a certain way. We can be induced to make movements without willing them, as Dr. Wilder Penfield showed with brain surgery patients at Montreal&#x2019;s McGill University in the 1950s. He would stimulate an area of the motor cortex, and the person&#x2019;s arm would move. He would then warn the patient this was going to happen, and the patient would even try to stop it with his left arm, but it moved nonetheless. Conscious will was certainly not necessary for the arm movement; conscious will could not even prevent it. Gazzaniga argued that the conscious mind makes sense of our unconsciously generated behaviors after the fact, creating a positive, plausible narrative about what we are doing and why. Obviously, there is no guarantee that these after-the-fact accounts are accurate. Gazzaniga&#x2019;s insight put the Delphic adage &#x201c;Know thyself&#x201d; in a startling new light and raised new questions about the notion of free will.<br> <br>On any given day, how much of what we say, feel, and do is under our conscious control? More important, how much is not? And most crucial of all: If we understood how our unconscious worked&#x2014;if we knew why we do what we do&#x2014;could we finally, fundamentally know ourselves? Could insights into our hidden drivers unlock different ways of thinking, feeling, and acting? What might this mean for our lives?<br> <br>Before You Know It examines these questions, as well as dozens of others that are just as complex and urgent. To begin, though, we need to look at why human experience works this way. Once we acquire the right frame for understanding the interplay between the conscious and unconscious operations of our mind, new opportunities open up to us. We can learn to heal wounds, break habits, overcome prejudices, rebuild relationships, and unearth dormant capabilities. This, to invoke two more Led Zeppelin songs, is when transformative possibilities stop being &#x201c;Over the Hills and Far Away&#x201d; and begin to appear &#x201c;In the Light.&#x201d;<br> We Know What We Don&#x2019;t Know<p></p> <br>My brother-in-law Pete is a rocket scientist. Literally. He and I grew up in small-town Champaign together, and then he, my sister, and I all did our undergraduate work together at the University of Illinois. When I went on to the University of Michigan for my postgraduate work, he joined the navy and became an expert in antenna-guided missile systems. He&#x2019;s very smart.<br> <br>I had been teaching at New York University for a few years in the 1980s when I went to spend a couple of weeks with my family at our little cabin in Leelanau County, Michigan, popularly called the &#x201c;Little Finger&#x201d; of the state. In the winter, this part of the country is a cold, forbidding expanse of snow-covered fields and gray skies, but during the summer it is twinkling lakes with Caribbean-colored waters, sand dunes rolling with happy kids, and smoky barbecues and fish boils set against sunsets over emphatically green trees. My dad bought our little unheated cabin when we were kids and we spent our entire summers there for many very special years.<br> <br>On one particular day, the lake&#x2019;s surface was calm except for the occasional ripples that came from silent, unfelt winds. It was the perfect respite from noisy New York City, where I spent the other fifty weeks of the year. My brother-in-law and I were both early risers, so we sat in the screened-in living room having coffee, taking in the morning light.<br> <br>&#x201c;So tell me about the latest and greatest findings in your lab,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I explained how we were finding that conscious awareness and intention were not always the source of our reactions to the world around us. &#x201c;For example,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s this thing called the Cocktail Party Effect. Say you&#x2019;re at a party, and you suddenly hear someone saying your name over on the other side of the room. You didn&#x2019;t hear anything she said before she said your name, and you might not even have known she was at the party. Amidst all the noise, you were filtering out everything but what the person talking to you was saying, yet still your name managed to get through the filter. Why your name but nothing else? That was the first study we did, showing that we automatically process our name and other important things about our self-concept, without even knowing it.&#x201d;<br> <br>My brother-in-law looked at me blankly. I figured I hadn&#x2019;t been clear, so I continued. I explained how our opinions of other people&#x2014;for example, our first impressions&#x2014;could be influenced unconsciously, even manipulated, by our experiences right before meeting. I had seen this firsthand in experiments my lab had conducted, and it was quite startling. &#x201c;Basically,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;what we keep finding is that much of how the mind operates is hidden to us, and that it shapes our experience and behavior in ways that we&#x2019;re not the least bit aware of. The exciting part is that through our experiments, we&#x2019;re beginning to detect these unconscious mechanisms, to see these invisible patterns in our mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>At this point Pete interrupted me, shaking his head. &#x201c;That just can&#x2019;t be, John,&#x201d; he blurted. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember one time when I was influenced unconsciously!&#x201d;<br> <br>Exactly, I thought. That&#x2019;s the whole point, isn&#x2019;t it? You can&#x2019;t remember any, because you were never aware of them in the first place.<br> <br>My rocket-scientist brother-in-law couldn&#x2019;t shake his strong belief&#x2014;based on his lifelong personal experience&#x2014;that everything he did was a product of his conscious choice. This is totally understandable. Our experience is by definition limited to what we are aware of. On top of this, it&#x2019;s bizarre and even slightly terrifying to entertain the possibility that we aren&#x2019;t as firmly in control of our thoughts and actions as our consciousness leads us to believe. It&#x2019;s hard to accept that there are forces moving the ship of self besides the conscious captain at the helm.<br> <br>To truly understand the way unconscious influences operate within us every moment of every day, we must acknowledge that there is a major disconnect between what we are aware of at any given moment and what else is going on in the mind at the same time. There is so much more going on than we are aware of. It is like those graphs of electromagnetic wavelengths in physics, from smallest to largest&#x2014;we can only see a small fraction of those wavelengths, called the visible spectrum. That doesn&#x2019;t mean all the other wavelengths aren&#x2019;t there&#x2014;just that they are invisible to us: infrared, ultraviolet, radio, X-rays, and many more. Though we can&#x2019;t see those invisible wavelengths of energy with the naked eye, we do now have devices and technology to detect them and measure their effects. It is the same with our unseen mental processes: we may not be aware of them directly but science is now able to detect them, and we can learn to detect them, too&#x2014;and by learning to see what is hidden, we acquire a new set of eyes. Or maybe just a new pair of prescription glasses we hadn&#x2019;t realized we&#x2019;d needed. (&#x201c;Look at everything I&#x2019;ve been missing!&#x201d;) What&#x2019;s more, you don&#x2019;t have to be a rocket scientist to use them.<br> The Three Time Zones<p></p> <br>Until recently, it was not possible to systematically and rigorously test how the unconscious affects our thoughts and actions. Scientists only had theories, case studies from clinical patients, and patchy experimental evidence, which naturally fueled an ongoing debate. The idea of unconscious parts of the mind, mental processes operating without our awareness, existed long before Freud. Darwin, for example, used it repeatedly in his 1859 magnum opus, On the Origin of Species, to refer to how the farmers and breeders of his day unconsciously used the principles of natural selection to grow larger ears of corn and breed fatter cows and woollier sheep. He meant that the farmers and breeders were not aware of the reason why what they did worked or of the underlying mechanism behind it&#x2014;and they were especially unaware of the larger implications of the natural selection mechanism in regard to religious beliefs about the supernatural creation of the world, including all its animals and plants. Later in the nineteenth century, Eduard von Hartmann published a book called the Philosophy of the Unconscious, which amounted to nothing more than rampant speculation about the mind and its inner workings, with no data and a scarcity of logic and common sense to boot. This book became very popular and had already been republished nine times by 1884. William James, one of the fathers of modern psychology, disliked Von Hartmann&#x2019;s completely unscientific account of the unconscious regions of the mind, so much so that it provoked his famous dismissal of the unconscious as &#x201c;a tumbling ground for whimsies.&#x201d; Yet twenty years later, after meeting Sigmund Freud for the first time and hearing him give a talk on the meaning of dreams, James was favorably impressed with the medical approach to the unconscious mind and told Freud his work was the future of psychology. James appreciated Freud&#x2019;s efforts to move beyond easy armchair speculations to close clinical observations and interventions to alleviate his patients&#x2019; distress and symptoms.<br> <br>But then, just a few years after this first and only meeting between these two titans of psychology, James and Freud, came a seismic reaction from the scientific establishment of the time against the study of the mind. The conscious reports by participants in psychology studies about their internal experience, called introspection, were not considered reliable sources of evidence, because the same person would report different things at different times when faced with the same circumstances. (Indeed, one of the themes of this book is our human lack of accurate introspective access and knowledge about how our mind works&#x2014;yet the scientists of the time were relying on their study participants to be able to report accurately on how their minds worked.) In 1913, John B. Watson famously stated that scientific psychology should therefore not attempt to study thought and conscious experience at all. The consequence of this was catastrophic. As Arthur Koestler wrote in his devastating 1967 critique of behaviorism, The Ghost in the Machine, Watson and the behaviorists had made a colossal logical error that caused the study of the mind&#x2014;whether conscious or unconscious&#x2014;to be excluded from scientific psychology for the next fifty years. As Koestler notes, this was a time when the other sciences, in stark contrast, were making tremendous advances. The dominant &#x201c;behaviorist&#x201d; school of psychology as founded by Watson argued vehemently that we were entirely the product of our environment. What we saw, heard, and touched&#x2014;and little else&#x2014;determined the things we did.

Most students spend hours agonizing over their hopes for Friday night and, later, dissecting the evenings' successes or failures, often wishing that the social contract of the hookup would allow them to ask for more out of sexual intimacy. The pressure to participate comes from all directions&#x2014;from peers, the media, and even parents. But how do these expectations affect students themselves? And why aren't parents and universities helping students make better-informed decisions about sex and relationships?<br><br>In <i>The End of Sex</i>, Donna Freitas draws on her own extensive research to reveal what young men and women really want when it comes to sex and romance. Surveying thousands of college students and conducting extensive one-on-one interviews at religious, secular public, and secular private schools, Freitas discovered that many students&#x2014;men and women alike&#x2014;are deeply unhappy with hookup culture. Meaningless hookups have led them to associate sexuality with ambivalence, boredom, isolation, and loneliness, yet they tend to accept hooking up as an unavoidable part of college life. Freitas argues that, until students realize that there are many avenues that lead to sex and long-term relationships, the vast majority will continue to miss out on the romance, intimacy, and satisfying sex they deserve.<br><br>An honest, sympathetic portrait of the challenges of young adulthood, <i>The End of Sex</i> will strike a chord with undergraduates, parents, and faculty members who feel that students deserve more than an endless cycle of boozy one night stands. Freitas offers a refreshing take on this charged topic&#x2014;and a solution that depends not on premarital abstinence or unfettered sexuality, but rather a healthy path between the two.<br><br></p><p><b>Donna Freitas</b> is the author of <i>Sex and the Soul: Juggling Sexuality, Spirituality, Romance and Religion on America's College Campuses</i>, and she has lectured at more than seventy-five colleges and universities around the country on hookup culture and how college students today find meaning (or don't) during the college experience.

Freitas's work is important because it offers a third way toward sexual independence and autonomy in an America caught between Puritanism and pornography. Rather than morally condemning college students for promiscuity or telling them to treat romance with the detached analysis of the headhunter, she is promising them that better sex more fun, excitement, and intensity is available."<br><br><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i><br>"Illuminating....

"WHO OWNS THE WEST? asks the important question that is at the heart of the change transforming the region, and no one is better prepared to lead this discussion than William Kittredge"&#x2014;<em>The Bloomsbury Review</em>.</p><p>The once-remote interior of the American West is changing, noted author William Kittredge writes, filling with tourists and new settlers, yielding &#34;a time of profound transition, which can be thought of as a second colonization.&#34; The West of myth, the place of Shanelike loners such as Kittredge&#39;s father who carved out a farm from a pocket of southeast Oregon bottomland, must, he argues, give way to a new generation of Westerners who love the land and its possibilities. Kittredge populates his pages with fellow dreamers, writers like Raymond Carver and Richard Hugo, old neighbors, and newcomers, all of whom contribute to Westerners&#39; &#34;working to locate ourselves amid the clutter.&#34; This is a striking, constantly interesting attempt at envisioning one&#39;s home country in the midst of change.Who owns the West? &#34;All of us, of course&#34;, says William Kittredge, but this &#34;simple answer... is sort of beside the point when we get down to considering questions of fairness. Stay joyous under the sun and moon, in the rain and out; that&#39;s another halfway answer&#34;. Kittredge gives us not easy answers but a sustained meditation on what it means to be a Westerner today. The three essays in Who Owns the West? compose both a celebration of the new West and an elegy for an old West that is fading. Noting that &#34;our ideas of paradise originate in childhood&#34;, Kittredge describes, in &#34;Heaven on Earth&#34;, growing up in the highland desert country of east Oregon, &#34;an ancient horseback world that is mostly gone&#34;. Next, in &#34;Lost Cowboys and Other Westerners&#34;, he gives us a series of portraits of inhabitants of the region. Finally, in &#34;Departures&#34;, Kittredge turns his eye to the West today, the &#34;new heartland nation&#34; that is being born from the pain and the glory of the past and the struggles and anger of the present.</p><h2>One More and We re Outnumbered!: Baby Blues Scrapbook No. 8 (One More &amp; We're Outnumbered!)</h2><p><p> Their life is hectic, filled with terrible twos, teething, and temper tantrums . . . but Darryl and Wanda wouldn't have it any other way!</p><p> Since 1990, the MacPhersons have staked their engaging claim on the comics page with their realistically wild-eyed and worn-down reaction to parenting.

Combining poetry, wit, polemic, and dazzling scholarship with memorial and autobiography, these essays have set new standards of passion and truthfulness for current theoretical writing.<br>The essays range from Diderot, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James to queer kids and twelve-step programs; from "Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl" to a performance piece on Divine written with Michael Moon; from political correctness and the poetics of spanking to the experience of breast cancer in a world ravaged and reshaped by AIDS. What unites <i>Tendencies</i> is a vision of a new queer politics and thought that, however demanding and dangerous, can also be intent, inclusive, writerly, physical, and sometimes giddily fun.</p><p>&#34;Because of the polymorphousness of its disciplinary perversity, &#34;Tendencies, &#34; taken together with Sedgwick&#39;s two previous books, virtually defines the new field of queer studies. The opulent availability of an embodied self who also happens to be a brilliant reader marks Sedgwick&#39;s effort throughout this volume. It is also what allows one the tutelary space for taking, not only pleasure from her work, but courage from her example.&#34;--James Creech, author of &#34;Closet Writing/Gay Reading&#34;<p>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick is Distinguished Professor of English, CUNY Graduate Center.

Robinson has done a great service in revitalizing Lorenzo Scupoli's classic,&nbsp;<i>Spiritual Combat</i>, so that contemporary Catholics can rediscover this rich work that has served many generations of Catholics. This book is about the life of prayer and personal reform and renewal. It fits squarely into the tradition of the "great masters" of the spiritual life, and to the line of great modern writers on spirituality. It is a work of particular relevance that confronts modern culture with the tough-minded, deeply authentic challenge of spiritual combat. <p>Robinson has retained Scupoli's appeal to the Catholic reader through a conversational style, short chapters, familiar examples from everyday life, and the pastoral bent which has marked his own outstanding career. Covering the basic difficulties of daily prayer and of obstacles to living the virtues, Scupoli and Robinson test the mettle of real Catholics by calling us to live an interior life for and with God.</p></p><p><p><b>Fr.

And since everyone knows peanuts don&#39;t belong in a bowl of Texas chili, China knows something suspicious is afoot...</p><p><i>Chile</i> is the pepper; <i>chili</i> (or sometimes <i>chilli</i>) is the spicy stew made with it. That's the first of many lessons about food, love, and death in Susan Wittig Albert's latest mystery about China Bayles, the Texas Hill Country lawyer turned herbalist and crime solver. Although Albert lives in the Texas Hill Country herself, she swears that China's hometown, Pecan Springs (which must have a higher per capita death rate than anyplace outside of Jessica Fletcher's Maine village), is fictional. So we have to believe that nobody really killed one of the judges of the annual Cedar Choppers Chili Cook-off by adding peanuts to his tasting sample and causing a deadly allergic reaction.<p> But China and her lover, ex-cop Mike McQuaid, believe it--especially after the dead chili judge, Jerry Jeff Cody, turns out to have a swampful of dirty secrets. So Albert begins a clever dance, keeping Bayles and the bedridden McQuaid (shot while working for the Texas Rangers) in just enough danger to maintain an atmosphere of suspense while also slipping in enough chile lore to outfit a chain of Taco Bells. The format may be familiar, but Albert is one of the best in the business at making it look newly hatched.

Unvarnished by sentiment or myth making, based on firsthand observations, and backed with statistical research, Olmsted's narrative captures the manners, foods, entertainments, and conversations of the Texans, as well as their housing, agriculture, business, exotic animals, changeable weather, and the pervasive influence of slavery. &nbsp;Back and forth from the Sabine to the Rio Grande, through San Augustine, Nacogdoches, San Marcos, San Antonio, Neu-Braunfels, Fredericksburg, Lavaca, Indianola, Goliad, Castroville, La Grange, Houston, Harrisburg, and Beaumont, Olmsted rode and questioned and listened and reported.

Slave ships and plantations are traversed by the visionaries as chronotopes containing layers of different times, imprinted by the experiences of the people held captive therein. The featured writers and visionaries attempt to visualize, hear, understand, and feel the experience of time overwritten -- the rewriting of conceptions of the past, present, and future of a people displaced by the transatlantic slave trade, and the erasure of their cultural memory. The works also examine perceptions of time and space in relation to Black memory, historical and societal change, systems, institutions, and technological development, and how these perceptions are sifted through or persist into the present. The main works propose innovative tools for shifting the linear progress narrative, suggest alternative perceptions and shapes of time, and create mechanisms for survival under the dominant linear temporal regime . Space-Time Collapse is a new experimental writing, sound,and image series that applies Black Quantum Futurism theory and practices to spatiotemporal collapse events and phenomenon. The first book in the series features new visions from Rasheedah Phillips, Camae Ayewa, Joy KMT, Thomas Stanley, PhD, Ytasha Womack, Dominique Matti, Theo Paijmans, Alex Smith, and Femi Matti, with a foreword by Alicia J.

He began with the Apostles and then moved to the Fathers of the Church. Next he presented the great Christian teachers of the late Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. In this volume, he picks up the thread in the high Middle Ages with the inspirational St. Francis and St. Dominic, followed by some of the men and women they profoundly influenced, such as Clare, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas.The collection goes beyond the Middle Ages and includes some Counter-Reformation saints, for example, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Robert Bellarmine. It concludes with a very popular saint closer to our own times who was made a Doctor of the Church by Pope John Paul II: Therese of Lisieux.The theme that unites these men and women across time is the constant need of the Church for renewal. In every generation, God raises up holy ones who challenge Christians to live as they ought--as true disciples of Christ.</p><p><p><b>Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI </b>(Joseph Ratzinger) is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age. As Pope he authored the best-selling <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>; and prior to his pontificate, he wrote many influential books that continue to remain important for the contemporary Church, such as <i>Introduction to Christianity</i> and <i>The Spirit of the Liturgy</i>.</p></p><h2>Naked Gymnastics</h2><p>People have always been fascinated by the beautiful, extremely well-trained and highly flexible bodies of female acrobats, dancers and athletes.

Never before had a fiction writer dealt with the Cultural Revolution in such Daoist-Confucian terms, discarding Mao-speak, and mixing both traditional and vernacular elements with an aesthetic that emphasized not the hardships and miseries of those years, but the joys of close, meaningful friendships. In <em>The King of Chess</em>, a student&#x2019;s obsession with finding worthy chess opponents symbolizes his pursuit of the dao; in <em>The King of Children</em>&#x2015;made into an award-winning film by Chen Kaige, the director of <em>Farewell My Concubine&#x2015;</em>an educated youth is sent to teach at an impoverished village school where one boy&#x2019;s devotion to learning is so great he is ready to spend 500 days copying his teacher&#x2019;s dictionary; and in the title novella a peasant&#x2019;s innate connection to a giant primeval tree takes a tragic turn when a group of educated youth arrive to clear the mountain forest. <em>The King of Trees</em> is a masterpiece of world literature, full of passion and noble emotions that stir the inner chambers of the heart.</p><p>Ah Cheng, born in Beijing in 1949, is the pen name of Zhong Acheng. An accomplished fiction writer, painter, and screenwriter, Ah Cheng spent the Cultural Revolution in a small village in Inner Mongolia, where he painted the sheep and grasslands, and then on a State Farm in Yunnan province. During the 1980s he came to prominence as a member of the &#x201c;primitive&#x201d; or &#x201c;seeking roots&#x201d; literary movement. In 1992 he received the Italian Nonino International Prize for his writings, and in 1995 his Venetian Diary was honored in Taiwan. He has lived in several countries including the U.S., often not writing and working various jobs such as fixing bicycles and house painting. In recent years he has lived on the outskirts of Beijing and though he refuses to publish, he continues to write.&#x201c;Nearly all the Chinese critics who discuss Ah Cheng&#x2019;s work go to great lengths to praise the spare, concentrated expressiveness of his prose style.... But they see in Ah Cheng&#x2019;s powerful language an indicator of something else, too&#x2015;they see in his style an extraordinary evocation of the Chinese national spirit, something that years of class struggle under Mao&#x2019;s aegis had sought simply to efface.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Theodore Huters, <em>Modern China</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Beginning in 1984 with the publication of Ah Cheng&#x2019;s novella <em>The King of Chess</em>, the last half of the 1980s represented a major turning point in contemporary Chinese fiction. From that time on, contemporary Chinese fiction has been &#x2018;walking toward the world&#x2019; (<em>zuoxiang shijie</em>), a phrase that may be taken to mean approaching the quality of the finest in world fiction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Duke, <em>World Literature Today</em></strong></p><h2>Madame Pamplemousse and Her Incredible Edibles</h2><p>Madame Pamplemousse and Her Incredible Edibles</p><p>This is Rupert Kingfisher&#39;s first book although he is working on another. His favourite authors as a child were Roald Dahl, Susan Cooper and Ursula le Guin. He also loved American horror comics and French cartoon books such as Asterix and Tintin. It was on a family holiday to Paris that he visited a bookshop dedicated to books such as Tintin - and also ate anchovies for the first time, on a pizza from a street vendor. He says that both experiences were equally life-changing. Rupert studied Philosophy at Bristol University and Play Writing at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Rupert has had plays performed in Dublin, Edinburgh, London and on BBC Radio 4. He grew up in Oxfordshire and now lives in Brentford, Middlesex.Grade 3&#x2013;4&#x2014;Madame Pamplemousse makes the rarest, most delicious delicacies in all of Paris in the basement of her small, shabby-looking shop. Monsieur Lard, who runs a fancy restaurant, The Squealing Pig, wants to be recognized as a famous chef, but his cooking is "revolting." His young niece discovers Madame Pamplemousse's shop when the restaurant runs out of p�t� and she is sent to buy some. Word gets out about how wonderful it is, and Monsieur Langoustine, the most powerful food critic in Paris, books a table at the restaurant. Monsieur Lard volunteers Madeleine to be Madame's assistant so he can get one of her mysterious recipes. The child is given precise but minimal instructions and discovers the secret to Madame Pamplemousse's success. The friendship that develops between them is nicely done, and the fairy-tale ending is satisfying. Charming pen-and-ink spot art is a humorous accompaniment to this fanciful tale.&#x2014;<i>Debbie S.

In every one, dark forces threatened Greece; terrible evil was poised to reenter the world. The future held only one hope: a half-caste Spartan boy, Parmenion. So Tamis made it her mission to see that Parmenion would before the deadliest warrior in the world -- no matter what the cost.<br>Raised to manhood in Sparta, bullied and forced to fight for his life every day, Parmenion had no notion of the unseen dimensions of magic and mystery that shaped his fate. He grew in strength and cunning. His military genius earned him the title Strategos in Sparta. His triumphs for the city of Thebes made him a hero. And finally his fate led him to the service of Philip of Macedon.<br>As Tamis had foreseen, Parmenion's destiny was tied to the Dark God, to Philip, and to the yet-unborn Alexander. All too soon the future was upon them. Parmenion stood poised to defeat evil -- or to open the gate for the Dark God to reenter the world.</p><p>David Gemmell&#39;s first novel, LEGEND was published in 1984, beginning his acclaimed Drenai saga. He was widely regarded as Britain&#39;s king of heroic fantasy. He died in July 2006.BOOK ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> A wonderful people are the Athenians. They elect ten new generals every year. In all my life I have known only one&#x2014;and that is Parmenion.<br> &#x2014;PHILIP II OF MACEDON<br> &nbsp;<br> SPRING, 389 B.C.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had begun with a morbid fascination to know the day of her death. She had tracked the limitless paths of the future, tracing the myriad lines of possible tomorrows. In some futures she had died of illness or plague, in others of seizures or murder. In one she had even fallen from a horse, though riding was distasteful to her and she could not imagine ever being persuaded to mount such a beast.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as she idly traced the possibilities, she became aware of a dark shadow at the edge of her last tomorrow. No matter when she died, the shadow was constant. It began to gnaw at her. With all the thousands of futures, how could this shadow remain? Tentatively she moved beyond the days of her death and saw the futures expand and grow. The shadow was stronger now, its evil palpable. And in a moment that touched her beyond terror she realized that even as she knew of the shadow, so it was becoming aware of her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet Tamis was not without courage. Steeling herself, she chose a path and flew to the heart of the shadow, feeling the power of the Dark God eating into her soul like acid. She could not hold her presence here for long and fled back to the transient security of a solid present.<br> &nbsp;<br> The knowledge she had gained became a terrible weight that burdened the old priestess. She could share it with no one and knew that at the most critical moment, when the evil needed to be challenged, she would be dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> She prayed then, harder than she ever had, her thoughts spinning out into the cosmos. A darkness grew inside her mind, then a single light shone and she saw a face, lined but strong, hawklike with piercing blue eyes beneath a helm of iron. The face blurred and faded, to be replaced by that of a boy. Yet still the eyes were piercing blue, the mouth set in a determined line. A name came to her. But was it that of a savior or a destroyer? She could not know; she could only hope. But the name echoed in her mind like distant thunder.<br> &nbsp;<br> Parmenion!<br> &nbsp;<br> SPARTA, SUMMER, 385 B.C.<br> &nbsp;<br> They came at him silently from the shadows, faces hooded and masked, wooden clubs raised.<br> &nbsp;<br> Parmenion darted to the left, but two more attackers ran into his path and a club slashed past his head, grazing his shoulder. His fist hammered into the masked face, then he cut to the right and sprinted toward Leaving Street. The cold, marble eyes of the statue of Athena gazed down on the boy as he ran, drawing him on toward her. Parmenion leapt to the base of the statue, clambering up to stand against the stone legs.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come down! Come down!&#x201d; chanted his tormentors. &#x201c;We have something for you, mix-blood!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then come up and give it to me,&#x201d; he told them. The five attackers ran forward. Parmenion&#x2019;s foot lashed into the face of the first, hurling him back, but a club cracked against his leg to knock him from his feet. He rolled, kicking out and sending an assailant sprawling, then he was up again and leaping high over them to land heavily on the street. A hurled club took him between the shoulder blades, and he staggered. Instantly they were upon him, pinning his arms.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now we have you,&#x201d; said a voice, muffled by the woolen scarf masking the mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need the mask, Gryllus,&#x201d; hissed Parmenion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d know you by the smell.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You will not contest the final tomorrow,&#x201d; said another voice. &#x201c;You understand? You should never have been allowed to take part. The general&#x2019;s games are for Spartans, not half-breeds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Parmenion relaxed, his manner becoming subdued, his head dropping. The hold on his arms eased&nbsp;...&nbsp;suddenly he wrenched free, his fist thundering into Gryllus&#x2019; face. They swarmed in on him then, punching and kicking, driving him to his knees. Gryllus hauled him up by his hair as the others pinned his arms once more.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You asked for this,&#x201d; said Gryllus, drawing back his fist. Pain exploded in Parmenion&#x2019;s jaw, and he sagged against his captors. The blows continued, short, powerful hooks to the belly and face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Parmenion did not cry out. There is no pain, he told himself. There is no&nbsp;...&nbsp;pain.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the night watch!&#x201d; whispered one of his captors. Loosing their hold on Parmenion, the youths sprinted off into an alleyway. Parmenion fell to the street and rolled. Above him loomed the silent statue of Athena of the Road. As he groaned and lurched to his feet, two soldiers ran to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What happened to you?&#x201d; asked the first, gripping Parmenion&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I fell.&#x201d; Parmenion shook loose the helping hand and spit blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And your friends were assisting you to rise, I suppose,&#x201d; grunted the man. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you walk with us for a while?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I need no escort,&#x201d; Parmenion told them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The soldier looked into the youth&#x2019;s pale blue eyes. &#x201c;They are still in the alley,&#x201d; he said, keeping his voice low.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I did not doubt it,&#x201d; answered Parmenion, &#x201c;but they&#x2019;ll not take me unawares again.&#x201d; As the soldiers moved away, Parmenion sucked in a deep breath and began to run, ducking into alleys and cutting left and right toward the marketplace. For a while he heard his pursuers, but then there was only the silence of the city night.<br> &nbsp;<br> They would expect him to make either for the barracks or for the home of his mother. He would do neither. Instead he ran through the deserted marketplace and on to the sanctuary hill above the city.<br> &nbsp;<br> Back at the statue of Athena an old woman stepped out into the moonlight, leaning on a long staff. She sighed and sat down on a marble seat, her body weary, her mind touched with sorrow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am sorry, Parmenion,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Strong though you are, I must make you iron. You are a man of destiny.&#x201d; She thought then of the other boys in the barracks. How easy it was to make them hate the half-breed, such a simple enchantment. To heal a boil took more psychic energy than to encourage hatred. It was a disturbing thought, and Tamis shivered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Glancing up at the statue, she saw the blind marble eyes staring down at her. &#x201c;Do not be so haughty,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I know your true name, woman of stone. I know your weaknesses and your desires, and I have more power than you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Tamis pushed herself to her feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> A face came to her mind, and she smiled. Despite the enchantment Parmenion had one friend, a boy impervious to the fuel of hatred. Although it went against her plans, yet still she found the thought comforting.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sweet Hermias,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If all men were like you, then my work would not be necessary.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Climbing Mt.

America&#x2019;s founders never could have foreseen the Internet, but somehow, the words and principles they lay down in the United States Constitution in 1787 remain as relevant today as they were when they were written.<br> The Constitution remains the basis for our government, but is only one of many documents that have shaped and defined the American character. This book looks at the words and ideas from forty-one of the most important documents and speeches in American history. These are words that capture the battles, the crises, the values, and the politics of a developing government. These words are living history, telling the story of a new nation whose destiny was far from certain&#x2014;and which continues, in the twenty-first century, to unfold. The words in this book, compiled from speeches, pamphlets, letters, declarations, and even songs, represent the past, present, and future of our nation.<br> When the Mayflower left the shores of England in 1620, its passengers were seeking religious freedom and escape from the seemingly endless wars that were plaguing Europe at the time. They regarded the New World as virgin territory&#x2014;although Native Americans had been living there for millenia. Some of the Europeans simply wanted better economic opportunity. The leaders on the Mayflower knew that with the king and English authority so distant, they would need a governing document if they were to succeed as a colony in the New World. Before they even touched land, they developed the compact that bound them together in obedience first to God and to the king&#x2014;but most importantly for the American story, to each other. The authority of their government came from the consent of the governed, and the idea of self-government was planted on North American soil. So began the series of trials and errors that turned settlements into colonies, colonies into states, and states into a nation.<br> The Mayflower Compact and other documents connect our past to our present. Generations of Americans since then have developed, interpreted, and applied the concepts in these documents to changing events and social conditions. From the Declaration of Independence (1776), to the Declaration of Sentiments (1848), to the Declaration of Indian Purpose (1961), this country&#x2019;s sense of government, freedom, and citizenship runs through its veins and finds its expression in print.<br> Besides these cornerstone documents, many of the other documents chosen represent turning points in American history. Their existence altered the course, or direction, of the nation by influencing popular opinion, or by giving expression to the evolving values of the American population. Afterward, the country and the people were forever changed. This was true of Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s account of his life as a slave, which informed a still-skeptical society of the horrors of slavery. Douglass&#x2019;s 1852 speech about the meaning of the Fourth of July to black Americans&#x2014;most of whom were still enslaved&#x2014;still reverberates today.<br> Some of the documents included here expanded the idea of citizenship by letting more voices be heard in our society. This was not done without struggle. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment secured the vote for African-American men. Fifty years later, in 1920, the approval of the Nineteenth Amendment gave women the same right. In 2015, the Supreme Court extended the guarantees of equal treatment under the law to same-sex couples in the landmark Ober&#x1f5;efell v. Hod&#x1f5;es decision.<br> The nation&#x2019;s expansion took economic forms as well. Although it began as a nation of farmers, the United States ultimately became a great industrial power. By the end of the nineteenth century, waves of immigrants searching for jobs entered the United States in greater numbers than before. Most of the newcomers settled in cities, where they added to the richness and diversity of American life. Included in this collection is a 1910 account by reformer Jane Addams of the poor conditions immigrants had to face. Indeed, as reformers like Addams tried to include newcomers in American life, prejudice against immigrants and minorities was widespread, and many Americans were concerned that immigrants would take their jobs away. In 1967, C�sar Ch�vez&#x2019;s moving words to striking Mexican farmworkers in California gave notice that the question of immigrants&#x2019; rights was far from resolved. Chavez&#x2019;s speech led to dramatically improved working and living conditions for thousands of immigrant workers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Civil Rights movement was perhaps the defining movement of U.S. history in the latter part of the twentieth century. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. the Board of Education that segregated schools favored whites at the expense of blacks, because black schools simply didn&#x2019;t get the resources that white schools did. The ruling overturned the idea of &#x201c;separate but equal,&#x201d; which had been the law of the land, and which had allowed segregation to keep blacks from receiving opportunities for education and economic success equal to whites. Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x2019;s 1963 &#x201c;I Have a Dream&#x2019; speech built upon this assertion and led inexorably to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964&#x2014;a crucial milestone in the ongoing struggle for blacks to gain equal treatment under the law. Barack Obama&#x2019;s speech on race, given when he was an Illinois senator campaigning for the presidency in 2008, provides a more recent picture of where that struggle stands<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The World Conquerors</h2><p>WORLD CONQUERORS expresses some of the bitterness and contempt of enslaved Europeans for the rulers of the &#39;&#39;victorious nations.&#39;&#39; It shows that by being urged to throw off the German yoke, the central European nations were tricked into becoming satellites of the Soviet. WORLD CONQUERORS indicates the real war criminals. It gives horrifying glimpses of the agony behind the Iron Curtain and describes the plot to extend the slave system to the Western world. Thousands of copies of the Hungarian edition have been sold and this English translation is published to warn the West. It is written by one who is a firm friend of the English-speaking people but an implacable foe of their vacillating and corrupt governments.</p><p></p><h2>House Name (House War)</h2><p><b>In this epic fantasy series for fans of George R.

Stray strands of ebony hair flew, limned in blue and red.<br><br>&#x201c;Sor Na Shannen.&#x201d; It was Lord Isladar who spoke. Even Karathis was silent.<br><br>She wheeled, her hands now shaped in fists, the perfect length of her nails also glittering with traces of dark light. She waited for his anger, his accusation, or the cool tones of his mockery; failure, if it did not destroy, had other consequences. She was not of a mind to accept them with grace.<br><br>But he was Lord Isladar, the least predictable of the Kialli lords. &#x201c;We have been prepared for discovery for some time. It has come later, rather than earlier.&#x201d; He glanced at Lord Karathis, who nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Ariane has . . . disturbed the gate; she is now aware of what she faces. Whether or not she can intervene again remains to be seen&#x2014;but it is my suspicion that she cannot.&#x201d; He knelt; the marble into which she had driven her sword was cracked, and the crack ran the length of the polished stone from one side of the coliseum to the other. &#x201c;We have failed in our attempt to take House Terafin, but it was never necessary; it would have been convenient, no more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would have given us the opportunity,&#x201d; Karathis cut in, his voice rumbling and crackling, &#x201c;to destroy the god-born in the heart of their own domain. With their destruction, the Empire would have been in chaos just as the Lord emerged.&#x201d;<br><br>Isladar nodded; that had, indeed, been the plan. It was not, however, the first time a plan would be frustrated; nor was it likely to be the last. Individually, mortals were beneath notice. This was an acknowledged truth. But in the aggregate? They were powerful and capable. This second truth, however, was less acknowledged, and when it was, in however reluctant a way, it was qualified: The god-born were mortal, but they bore the blood of the gods.<br><br>&#x201c;We will not now have that opportunity,&#x201d; Isladar continued softly. &#x201c;But it was never required.&#x201d; He tendered the enraged demon a brief nod. &#x201c;We have what we require, if we are careful, and if your servitors can be kept in check.<br><br>&#x201c;We will begin, Karathis and I, to close the ways.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We will not now have Scarran,&#x201d; she said, grudging the slower burn of her rage.<br><br>&#x201c;We will. The damage done by the Winter Queen will require the whole of the darkest night to repair. Can you do it?&#x201d; he asked. It was a challenge.<br><br>But it was, as well, a gift, and it mollified her. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then stay; we must go in haste. Tell us only what you know of the entrances that Ararath once used to wander these streets; it is there we will go first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does it matter? If they are found, we will merely add to the numbers of sacrifices required to dedicate the standing ground at the ceremony&#x2019;s close.&#x201d;<br><br>Isladar&#x2019;s silence was not gratifying. But, inasmuch as a <i>Kialli</i> lord could be, he had been gracious. She waited. &#x201c;It matters,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;If, by unforeseen circumstance, one such mortal should escape, the Kings will know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They will <i>know now</i>,&#x201d; she snarled.<br><br>Isladar chuckled. &#x201c;You have been decades in your dance among mortals of power,&#x201d; he pointed out. &#x201c;But you have not observed The Ten or their relationship with the Kings closely. I do not believe that it is so simple an affair as that. I believe that The Terafin will ask for&#x2014;will indeed <i>require</i>&#x2014;proof, before she approaches the Kings. Yes, if she chooses to do so without proof, they will hear her, and they will listen. But it might be politically costly for Terafin to do so.<br><br>&#x201c;It is therefore urgent that we find, and seal off, all entrances that Ararath used before his death. Or,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;all of the entrances gleaned from his thoughts before his death. They will be the most common, I think, and will also be the first searched.<br><br>&#x201c;We must give them nothing.&#x201d;<br><b>22nd of Scaral, 410 A.A</b>.<br><br><i>Healerie, House Terafin, Averalaan Aramarelas</i><br><br>Arann woke in the late afternoon.<br><br>The slightly rounded ceiling of the healerie was the first thing he expected to see, and when he opened his eyes, it was there.<br><br>Although he&#x2019;d never been in this room before, he knew it almost as well as he knew the den&#x2019;s apartment. He knew where the beds were laid out; he knew, as well, what the cupboards, recessed along the far wall, contained. He knew the women&#x2014;and men&#x2014;who had learned their craft from Alowan. He knew that Alowan, almost revered in Terafin, had steadfastly refused to take the House Name, and he even knew why: A House Name was a political statement, a statement of allegiance. Alowan&#x2019;s allegiance was to life, in all its forms, and more, to the preservation of life. Healer-born, and scarred by his talent&#x2014;more than most&#x2014;he had nonetheless chosen to serve. But service to The Terafin was not, in the end, service to the House. It was, in its entirety, service to the woman. Amarais Handernesse ATerafin.<br><br>Alowan had healed her, just as he had healed Arann. And he had left her, just as he had left Arann, bereft and on the shoals of life, as if life were an unexpected burden.<br><br>But she had borne it. She had accepted the gift, and in return, she had offered Alowan the healerie for as long as he was willing to stay within her walls. She had offered him the House Name, but she had never expected him to accept it. And he had not disappointed, in the end.<br><br>Arann knew Alowan&#x2019;s life.<br><br>Alowan knew Arann&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Arann?&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced down from the curve of a ceiling beyond which the sun shone cool in the coming Scaral evening. Finch was seated beside his bed, her face pale, her hair clean and bound above her face. She wasn&#x2019;t Jay; tendrils didn&#x2019;t escape to cover her eyes.<br><br>She wore a pale cream dress with a simple belt; he couldn&#x2019;t see her feet, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. He reached for her with his left hand, and she met him halfway with both of hers. He tried not to crush her fingers.<br><br>She tried not to notice when he failed.<br><br>&#x201c;Finch.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;Jay told me to tell you&#x2014;&#x201d; she hesitated. &#x201c;There was trouble, in the House.&#x201d; Her voice dropped to a whisper. &#x201c;A mage came. There was magic. And Jay says . . . something tried to kill The Terafin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;It looked like Rath.&#x201d; She glanced around the empty room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not supposed to upset you. Or talk much, really.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. Waited. Neither of them had ever been big talkers, and it was always awkward when two quiet people had no loud buffers between them.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not sure what happened. Jay&#x2019;s going to talk with The Terafin tonight.&#x201d; Drawing a breath, she added, &#x201c;The Terafin&#x2019;s given us rooms here. Big rooms. And our own kitchen. And an old guy, Ellerson. I think he&#x2019;s one of the servants.&#x201d; She hesitated and then added, &#x201c;But his only job right now is us.&#x201d;<br><br>Arann nodded again.<br><br>&#x201c;Jay will come later if Alowan lets her in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He will.&#x201d;<br><br>She hesitated and then asked, &#x201c;Should I stay?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded again and closed his eyes. After a few minutes, he said, &#x201c;I think this is a good place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The healerie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The House.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head. &#x201c;The Terafin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What she wants isn&#x2019;t that different from what Jay wants.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jay wants to protect the rest of us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She wants to protect the things she loves. Right now, that&#x2019;s only us.&#x201d; Arann opened his eyes. &#x201c;But it won&#x2019;t always be only us.&#x201d; He glanced at the ceiling again, at the small cracks there. &#x201c;Jay thinks she failed,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;Because of Lefty.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch didn&#x2019;t mention the others by name, but he felt the small accusation in her silence. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Coming from Finch, the question surprised him enough that he pushed himself up the headboard into a seated position. He didn&#x2019;t, however, let go of Finch&#x2019;s hand, so the shift in position dragged her half out of her chair.<br><br>&#x201c;I think she failed,&#x201d; he said, after a long pause. &#x201c;She failed Lefty.&#x201d;<br><br>Before Finch could find words&#x2014;and it was pretty clear she was searching for them&#x2014;he added, &#x201c;But it wasn&#x2019;t her fault. All of us failed him. He&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dead.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t ask him how he knew. She knew where he had almost gone.<br><br>&#x201c;I was so angry, Finch. I was <i>so angry</i>. At myself. At Jay. At everything.&#x201d; He forced himself to release her hand, to lay his, white and trembling, against the coverlet across his lower body. &#x201c;But we don&#x2019;t fail if we don&#x2019;t try. Jay will always try. She won&#x2019;t always succeed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Arann&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s better to try. Because she won&#x2019;t always fail, either.&#x201d; He looked at Finch, then. Finch, who, like Arann, was still alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; a new voice said, and Finch turned to see Alowan, standing in the arch that separated the arboretum from the beds. &#x201c;She will not always fail.&#x201d;<br><br>Arann tensed. He couldn&#x2019;t help that. But he didn&#x2019;t try to stand; he didn&#x2019;t try to go to the old healer.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about your Jay,&#x201d; Alowan said quietly. His voice carried; there was nothing to break it. Even breath was almost silent in this place.<br><br>Finch glanced at Arann.<br><br>Arann said, &#x201c;He knows what I know. He&#x2019;s not asking me.&#x201d;<br><br>Alowan grimaced slightly but nodded. &#x201c;Tell me, Finch, about the first time you met Jay.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch hesitated. But Alowan&#x2019;s age and the peaceful wisdom he radiated couldn&#x2019;t be reduced to simple threat; it couldn&#x2019;t be ignored as distant authority. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she asked, at last.<br><br>&#x201c;She reminds me of someone, I think. And I would like to know what you see in her.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch spread her hands. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s Jay. She saved my life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you stayed with her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had nowhere else to go.&#x201d; She hesitated again and then added, &#x201c;But even if I had, I would have wanted to stay with her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because she&#x2019;s Jay. She knows things. She believes in things. I think she wants to change the world. I know I can&#x2019;t, not by myself&#x2014;but if I stay with her, I might be able to help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does she know this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s never seemed important to her. Why we stay, I mean. I don&#x2019;t know if she really questions it.&#x201d;<br><br>Alowan nodded, as if that answer satisfied him. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t question it; she is young, and she is not yet what she will be. But it is there.&#x201d;<br>It was dark, and the moon&#x2019;s light filtered through the arboretum, silvering leaves and hanging plants, by the time Teller came to relieve Finch.<br><br>&#x201c;Jay&#x2019;s back,&#x201d; he whispered. He glanced at Arann, who was sleeping.<br><br>&#x201c;He sleeps a lot,&#x201d; Finch told him, as she vacated her chair. &#x201c;But so does Alowan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alowan&#x2019;s old.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;But . . . I like him.&#x201d;<br><br>Teller smiled. He took Arann&#x2019;s hand from hers and settled in. &#x201c;Jay&#x2019;ll come in the morning. She&#x2019;s cleared the kitchen,&#x201d; he added, with just the hint of a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;How did Ellerson take it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About as well as she expected.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch&#x2019;s grimace was delicate.<br><br>&#x201c;Did she speak with The Terafin?&#x201d;<br><br>Teller nodded. &#x201c;The Terafin offered her two solarii a day.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch couldn&#x2019;t whistle, and she seldom regretted the lack. She did make the attempt, now, and it fell into a quiet huff of breath, as it always did. &#x201c;For what?&#x201d; She was wary, but she wasn&#x2019;t entirely suspicious. Just a little. They would always have that &#x201c;little&#x201d; when dealing with the powerful.<br><br>&#x201c;Work.&#x201d; Teller hesitated. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not entirely certain <i>what</i> she wants, but she said&#x2014;&#x201d; he glanced at Finch. &#x201c;Maybe you should go back to the wing and let Jay explain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She won&#x2019;t say anything you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; They both knew that Teller&#x2019;s memory was better. He was, as far as they had one, a keeper of records, a minihistorian. It was Teller who transcribed Jay&#x2019;s dreams.<br><br>&#x201c;Jay says The Terafin wants proof that the undercity exists. She&#x2014;The Terafin&#x2014;sent people out to explore Rath&#x2019;s place and the subbasement. They found nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch frowned. &#x201c;In the basement?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;Nothing at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve <i>used</i> that entrance&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About a hundred times. They couldn&#x2019;t find it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe they&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jay thinks it wasn&#x2019;t there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How could a hole that size just&#x2014;just disappear?&#x201d;<br><br>Teller shrugged. He reached over and touched Arann&#x2019;s forehead with the back of his hand before nodding and returning to his chair. &#x201c;Probably magic,&#x201d; he told her, still gazing at Arann&#x2019;s sleeping face. &#x201c;We almost lost him.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch touched his shoulder gently.<br><br>&#x201c;We lost Duster.&#x201d;<br><br>She had saved Finch&#x2019;s life. Finch said nothing, waiting.<br><br>&#x201c;Jay wants to find the body if she can.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bury it. Have a funeral. She says we&#x2019;ll never find the others.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did she say when?&#x201d;<br><br>Teller shook his head. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s serious about the work for The Terafin. Because The Terafin promised two things in exchange for the work. The money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We get to stay. Here, in the wing, while Jay works.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And when she&#x2019;s done?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If she can prove her value to the House and to The Terafin, we&#x2014;&#x201d; He swallowed. &#x201c;We get to stay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll offer Jay the House Name.&#x201d;<br><br>Silence then. Of all the things they&#x2019;d been foolish enough to hope for, to dream of, in the streets of the twenty-fifth, in an apartment that was smaller than their single rooms, becoming <i>ATerafin </i>wasn&#x2019;t one of them. &#x201c;Jay won&#x2019;t look for Duster,&#x201d; Finch said quietly.<br><br>Teller nodded. Even in the gentle dark, his face was expressionless. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s practical,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;While there&#x2019;s <i>any</i> chance that she can do this, that she can prove she&#x2019;s useful, she&#x2019;ll concentrate on that to the exclusion of almost everything else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does she want us to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t said. Angel&#x2019;s biting through walls,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;because Jay&#x2019;s going to be searching&#x2014;on her own&#x2014;with the mage. He asked to go, and she said no.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did she take Carver?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s taking <i>no one</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So . . . we&#x2019;re supposed to sit around in our rooms and wait?&#x201d;<br><br>Teller nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve done worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I told Angel that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t impressed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not much.&#x201d; Teller hesitated again and then added, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s lost too much. She can&#x2019;t stop, and she can&#x2019;t think about it. This is better, for her.&#x201d;<br><br>Finch agreed. But the presence of a mage&#x2014;a known mage&#x2014;made her uneasy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go back,&#x201d; she told him and turned toward the arch.<br><br>&#x201c;Finch?&#x201d;<br><br>She paused.<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to the others. Talk to Ellerson.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What should I&#x2014;&#x201d; she stopped. &#x201c;I will. Watch Arann. He&#x2019;s really, really lonely,&#x201d; she added, searching for words and finding all of them inadequate.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the healing,&#x201d; Teller replied softly.<br><br>She wanted to ask him how he knew. But she didn&#x2019;t; he was Teller.<br><br>&#x201c;Rath told me once.&#x201d; He paused and then added, &#x201c;Rath&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br><br>So much death. So much death to bring them to the edge of House Terafin, upon the Isle.<br><br>She surprised herself when she spoke. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make it mean something.&#x201d; Looking back, she saw that she had his attention. &#x201c;The deaths,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make them count.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For anything, Teller. Duster died so the rest of us could live. Let&#x2019;s make it count.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You sound like Jay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are worse things to sound like.&#x201d; They both smiled, and she turned then and left the room, pausing for a moment to dip her fingers into ripples of moon-dappled water in the arboretum&#x2019;s fountain.</p><h2>Mary for Today</h2><p><p> Fr. von Balthasar provides a profound and concise spiritual guide for all who desire to know and love the Mother of the Lord. The acclaimed theologian gathers from the Sacred Scriptures and the rich tradition of the Church to present a portrait of Mary that shows her importance and relevance for Christians today.<br> <br> In this inspiring work, von Balthasar exhibits the quintessential elements of a great theologian: depth of traditional devotion combined with intellectual brilliance and seasoned with common sense. He reveals to us the crucial spiritual role of Mary for all Christians: she shows us what the Church is and guides us close to Jesus.<br> <br> For Christians to understand their vocations as individuals and as the Church, Mary is essential as the model of the first disciple. Von Balthasar captures her singular role when he quotes her words in the Gospel at Cana: "Do whatever he tells you." Perhaps nowhere is Mary's role and significance more clearly present than in this Gospel scene.<br> <br> This work is beautifully illustrated with lovely silhouette drawings by artist Virginia Broderick. </p></p><p><strong>Fr. Hans Urs von Balthasar</strong> (1905-1988), a Swiss theologian, was one of the most important Catholic thinkers and writers of the twentieth century. His many works address theology, literature, philosophy, and spirituality. Included among his books are his multi-volume works <em>The Glory of the Lord</em>, <em>Theo-Drama</em>, and <em>Theo-Logic</em>, and other well-known works such as <em>Love Alone Is Credible</em>, <em>Prayer</em>, and <em>Heart of the World</em>. Highly regarded by Pope John Paul II, who named him a cardinal of the Catholic Church, von Balthasar died shortly before being received into the sacred college.</p><h2>The Chieftain</h2><p>Connor, chieftain of the MacDonalds of Sleat, holds the fate of his people in his hands. Rival clans are plotting to take over his lands, and duty determines whom he will fight, trust . . . even marry. Seeking guidance, Connor turns to Ilysa, a young lass with the gift of foresight, who reveals an approaching danger-and a passion that burns only for him. But the warrior must make a powerful marriage alliance, and Ilysa's bloodline is far too humble. <br><br>With her powers to heal and see evil where others cannot, beautiful Ilysa dresses plainly, speaks softly, and loves her chieftain from afar. Yet when Connor finally stokes the embers of desire that have so long burned within her, Ilysa feels bliss unlike any she's ever known. Now as he is forced to place duty before happiness, Ilysa senses Connor is in grave peril. Can she find a way to prove she is the woman he needs by his side?</p><p>Margaret Mallory is the award-winning author of the Scottish historical romance series, THE RETURN OF THE HIGHLANDERS, and the medieval trilogy, ALL THE KING'S MEN.

It makes no frigging sense.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s okay; I&#x2019;m just going to chalk it up to another thing I will never understand about my girlfriend. Yes&#x2014;I said girlfriend. Dee Warren is officially my girlfriend.<br> <br>One more time for those in the back&#x2014;girlfriend&#x2014;Delores&#x2014;mine.<br> <br>Repeating it might make me sound like a Harry Styles&#x2013;obsessed prepubescent girl, but I don&#x2019;t give a damn. Because it was a hard-won victory&#x2014;if you knew what I had to go through to make her mine, you&#x2019;d understand.<br> <br>Anyway, back to what I was saying. Chicks like to cry&#x2014;but this isn&#x2019;t one of those stories. There&#x2019;s no dying best friends, no dark tortured pasts, no hidden secrets, no sparkly vampire breakups, and no kinky fuckery.<br> <br>Well . . . okay . . . there&#x2019;s some kinky fuckery&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s the happy kind.<br> <br>This is a story about a player, who meets a slightly crazy girl. They fall in love and the player changes his ways forever. It&#x2019;s a story you&#x2019;ve probably heard before, maybe even from my buddy, Drew Evans. But the thing is, while he and Kate were figuring their shit out? There was this whole alternate universe going on with Delores and me that you don&#x2019;t know about. So stick around, even if you think you already know the ending. Because the greatest part of a road trip isn&#x2019;t arriving at your destination. It&#x2019;s all the wild stuff that happens along the way.<br> <br>Before we start, there&#x2019;s some background info you may need to know. First off&#x2014;Drew&#x2019;s a great guy, a true best friend. If we were the Rat Pack, he&#x2019;d be Frank Sinatra, I&#x2019;d be Dean Martin. Although Drew and I are tight, we differ in our opinions about women. At this point in our tale, he sees himself as a bachelor for life. He&#x2019;s got all these rules about never bringing a chick to his apartment, never dating someone he works with, and the Cardinal Rule: Never hook up with the same woman twice.<br> <br>I, on the other hand, don&#x2019;t care where I get laid&#x2014;my place, her place, the observation deck of the Empire State Building.<br> <br>That was a great night.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m also not opposed to seeing someone from the office&#x2014;though most of the girls in my line of work are stressed out, chain smoking, coffee-obsessed women with an unpleasant chip on their shoulders. I have no problem hanging out with the same woman on multiple occasions, as long as the good times keep rolling. And someday, I imagine myself settling down&#x2014;marriage, kids, the whole deal.<br> <br>But while I&#x2019;m looking for Mrs. Right? I&#x2019;m having a blast with all the Ms. Wrongs.<br> <br>Secondly, I&#x2019;m a real glass-half-full kind of person. Nothing gets me down. I have a great life&#x2014;a good career that lets me enjoy the best man-toys on the market, awesome friends, a weird but loving family. &#x201c;Emo&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t exist in my vocabulary, but YOLO should&#x2019;ve been my middle name.<br> <br>Next up is Delores Warren&#x2014;Dee, if you want to stay on her good side. By today&#x2019;s standards it&#x2019;s an unusual name, but for her it&#x2019;s a perfect fit. She&#x2019;s unusual&#x2014;different&#x2014;in all the best kinds of ways. She&#x2019;s brutally honest, emphasis on &#x201c;brutal.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s strong and doesn&#x2019;t give a rat&#x2019;s ass what people think of her. She&#x2019;s true to herself and makes no apologies for what she wants or who she is. She&#x2019;s wild and beautiful&#x2014;like an undomesticated thoroughbred that runs best without a saddle.<br> <br>And that was where I almost went wrong. I wanted to tame her. I thought I had the patience for it, but I pushed too hard and pulled too much on the reins. So she broke them.<br> <br>Are you offended that I compared the woman I love to a horse? Get the fuck over it&#x2014;this is not a tale the PC police will enjoy.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself. Just know that Kate Brooks is our coworker and Delores&#x2019;s best friend&#x2014;the Shirley to Dee&#x2019;s Laverne. And in all the years I&#x2019;ve known Drew&#x2014;which is every one of them&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve never seen him react to a woman like he reacted to Kate. Their attraction, even though it was mostly antagonistic in the beginning, was palpable. Anybody with eyes could see they had it bad for each other.<br> <br>Well . . . anybody but them.<br> <br>Kate, like Delores, is a great girl. The type of woman who, in the immortal words of Eddie Murphy in Coming to America, could arouse a man&#x2019;s intellect as well as his loins.<br> <br>You got all that? Great. Let&#x2019;s get this party started.<br> <br>My life changed about four weeks ago. On a normal, average day&#x2014;when I met a girl who was anything but average.<br> <br><br> <br>Four weeks earlier<br> <br>&#x201c;Matthew Fisher, Jack O&#x2019;Shay, Drew Evans, this is Dee-Dee Warren.&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no such thing as love at first sight. It&#x2019;s just not possible. Sorry to ruin your fantasy, but that&#x2019;s how it is. Ignorance might feel like bliss, but when you peel away the happy layer, it&#x2019;s still just a lack of information.<br> <br>To really love another person, you have to know them&#x2014;their quirks, their dreams, what pisses them off and makes them smile, their strengths, weaknesses, and flaws. Have you heard that quote from the Bible&#x2014;the one they always read at weddings: &#x201c;Love is patient, love is kind . . .&#x201d;? I have my own version: Love is missing the taste of someone&#x2019;s morning breath. Thinking they&#x2019;re beautiful, even when their nose is Rudolph-red and their hair is bird&#x2019;s nest crazy. Love isn&#x2019;t putting up with someone in spite of their faults&#x2014;it&#x2019;s adoring them because of them.<br> <br>Now lust at first sight, that&#x2019;s very real. And much more common. In fact, when most guys meet a woman, they know within the first five minutes which category of &#x201c;fuck, kill, marry&#x201d; they fall into. For guys, the fuck category has a pretty low bar.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d like to tell you the first thing I noticed about Delores was something romantic, like her eyes, or her smile, or the sound of her voice&#x2014;but it wasn&#x2019;t. It was her tits. I&#x2019;ve always been a boob man, and Dee&#x2019;s set was fantastic. Slightly overflowing in a tight, hot-pink top, pressed together just right to create an enticing cleft of cleavage, beautifully framed by a gray knit sweater.<br> <br>Before she uttered her first word to me, I was in lust with Delores Warren&#x2019;s rack.<br> <br>After she banters with Drew for a minute, I steer her attention my way. &#x201c;So, Dee-Dee . . . is that short for something? Donna, Deborah?&#x201d;<br> <br>Warm, honey-colored eyes turn my way. But before she can answer, Kate lets the cat out of the bag, &#x201c;Delores. It&#x2019;s a family name&#x2014;her grandmother&#x2019;s. She hates it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Delores glares playfully at Kate.<br> <br>If you want to make an impression on a girl, humor is always a safe bet. It shows a woman you&#x2019;re clever, smart, confident. If you&#x2019;ve got balls? Flaunt them.<br> <br>Which is why I tell Kate&#x2019;s friend, &#x201c;Delores is a gorgeous name, for a gorgeous girl. Plus, it rhymes with clitoris . . . and I really know my way around them. Big fan.&#x201d;<br> <br>As planned, my line gets an instant reaction. She smiles slowly and runs one finger across her lower lip, suggestively. Any time a woman touches her body in response to something a guy&#x2019;s said? It&#x2019;s a good sign.<br> <br>Then, she breaks our gaze and says to us all, &#x201c;Anyhoo. I have to jet, gotta get to work. Nice meeting you, boys.&#x201d; Dee-Dee hugs Kate and winks at me. Also a good sign.<br> <br>I watch her as she walks out and can&#x2019;t help but notice the rear view is almost as awesome as the front.<br> <br>Drew asks Kate, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got to get to work? I thought the strip clubs didn&#x2019;t open until four.&#x201d;<br> <br>I have to agree with him on that one. When you&#x2019;ve been to as many strip clubs as we have, you start to see a pattern. The clothes the women wear&#x2014;though minimal&#x2014;are similar. Like they all shop at the same store. And Dee is definitely rocking the Strippers &#x201c;R&#x201d; Us vibe.<br> <br>Though it may just be wishful thinking on my part. It would be awesome if she were a dancer. Not only are they limber&#x2014;they party hard. Totally uninhibited. The fact that they generally have a low opinion of the male species is a plus too. Because it means the simplest act of chivalry is returned with extreme gratitude. And a grateful stripper is a blow-job giving stripper.<br> <br>But Kate dashes my hopes. &#x201c;Dee&#x2019;s not a stripper. She just dresses like that to throw people off. So they&#x2019;re shocked when they find out what she really does.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does she do?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a rocket scientist.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack reads my mind. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re fucking with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Afraid not. Delores is a chemist. One of her clients is NASA. Her lab works on improving the efficiency of the fuel they use on the space shuttles.&#x201d; She shivers. &#x201c;Dee-Dee Warren with access to highly explosive substances . . . it&#x2019;s something I try to not think about.&#x201d;<br> <br>And now my curiosity is almost as strong as my lust. I&#x2019;ve always had a taste for the unusual&#x2014;the exotic&#x2014;in women, music, books. And unlike Drew, whose apartment is meticulously decorated, I tend to gravitate toward pieces with a history. Even if they don&#x2019;t match, nontraditional is always interesting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Brooks, you&#x2019;ve got to hook me up. I&#x2019;m a nice guy. Let me take your friend out. She won&#x2019;t regret it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kate thinks about it. Then she says, &#x201c;Okay. Sure. You seem like Dee&#x2019;s type.&#x201d; She hands me a neon-green business card. &#x201c;But I have to warn you. She&#x2019;s the love-&#x2019;em-and-leave-&#x2019;em-with-bruises type of girl. If you&#x2019;re looking for a good time for a night or two, then definitely call her. If you&#x2019;re looking for anything deeper than that, I&#x2019;d stay away.&#x201d;<br> <br>And now I know how Charlie felt when he was handed the last golden ticket to Wonka&#x2019;s Chocolate Factory.<br> <br>I stand up from the table and kiss Kate on the cheek. &#x201c;You . . . are my new best friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>I consider hugging her too&#x2014;just to fuck with my scowling buddy&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t want to risk getting nut-punched. I have plans for my nuts. They need to be in top form.<br> <br>Kate tells Drew not to pout, and he makes a comment about her boobs, but I&#x2019;m only half listening. Because I&#x2019;m too busy thinking about where I&#x2019;ll be meeting Delores Warren for a drink&#x2014;or several. And all the fantastically lascivious activities that are sure to follow.<br> <br><br> <br>So that&#x2019;s how it started. It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be complicated&#x2014;no love at first sight, no grand gestures, no hard feelings. A sure thing, a good time, a one-night stand with an option for a second. That&#x2019;s what Kate told me Dee was into, and that&#x2019;s all I was looking for. All I thought it would ever be.<br> <br>Elvis Presley was right. Fools really do rush in. And if you haven&#x2019;t figured it out yet, I&#x2019;m a major fucking fool.</p><h2>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Rock Gardens</h2><p>Table of Contents A Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Rock Gardens Introduction Wrong Way Of Placing Rocks The Right Way to Place Rock Stones Good Rock Work- Flat Ground Wall Stones on Slopes Choosing the Best Soil Building Your Rock Garden Planting Your Rock Plants Maintenance Conifers Bulbs List of Rock Plants, depending on the Particular Conditions and Places Rock Plants For Walls Crazy paving plants &#x2013; Conclusion Author Bio Publisher Introduction Rock gardens have been part of landscaping and gardening lore for millenniums. In the East Japanese rock gardens or Zen gardens have been places where people could meditate in serene and harmonious surroundings. Why are more people designing their own gardens incorporating at least one rock garden in the design? Even if the rock garden is quite small, it is going to add a touch of distinction to the landscaping of your garden. In Japan, rock gardens were normally built as dry landscape gardens, where a number of landscapes were made up of natural compositions made from natural products incorporated into a landscape. These natural items included bushes, trees, Moss, water, rocks and sand. One believes that the concept of rock gardening originated in China, especially when the ancient religion of Shintoism spoke about places of harmony where one could commune with nature and the spirit in serenity. These were normally made in monasteries, where they could be seen from one focal point, like say the porch of the head priest of the monastery. These dry Landscape gardens which you call a Zen garden in Japan were built to be seen from one viewpoint, with the walling closed around it in ancient times. Nowadays they stretch on for miles incorporating all the natural features available and present in the area to make up harmonious surroundings. Japanese Zen gardens go back to 784 BC. Chinese gardens have been around for even longer. The incorporation of gravel and white sand in a Zen or rock garden was an important feature. These were the symbol of distance, emptiness, purity, white space and water. All these symbols were supposed to aid in meditation. White sand and gravel used harmoniously together were also used around temples, shrines and palaces.</p><p></p><h2>Tall, Dark, and Wicked (Wicked Trilogy)</h2><p><p><b>A wickedly wonderful new romance from the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>His Wicked Reputation</i></b>&nbsp; <br><br> <i>Most women will give him anything he wants.&nbsp;She is not most women...&nbsp; </i></p><p>As a well-known barrister and the son of a duke, Ives confines his passionate impulses to discreet affairs with worldly mistresses.

Unfortunately, he has already been asked to serve as the prosecutor in the case, but that only ensures close encounters with the rarity named Padua Belvoir.

He had jotted them down, in no particular order, during an idle moment the day before. Only the first one deserved its ranking without question. In fact, it should be underlined. There were other qualities that attracted him, too, but these six, he had learned through experience, were paramount.</p><p>He tucked the paper behind some pages, to be returned later to its current duty as a marker in his book. He settled into his favorite chair, propped his legs on a footstool with his feet aimed toward the low fire, and again turned his attention to a novel he had been meaning to read for four months now.</p><p>Vickers, his manservant, set a glass and two decanters, one of port and the other of water, on a table next to the chair, then stepped back out of view.</p><p>&#x201c;If your brother the duke should come by this evening, sir, should&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Deny him entrance. Bar the door. I am not home to him. If God had any mercy he would have inspired Lance to remain at Merrywood Manor, not allowed him to venture back up to town where he will be a nuisance to all whom he encounters. I am done with being his playmate, or his nursemaid.&#x201d; At least for a while, he added to himself. After a recent, renewed week of barking, the hounds had again retreated, but they had not given up the hunt.</p><p>Ives did not mind being his brother&#x2019;s keeper. He resented very much playing the role for a brother who treated his advice like it came from an old aunt. One would think that a man under suspicion of murder would be more circumspect in his speech and actions, and want to create favorable impressions, not stick out his tongue at society whenever he could.</p><p>&#x201c;Very good, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Padding steps. A door closing. Peace. Ives closed his eyes and savored for a moment that rarity in his life&#x2014;freedom to do whatever he damned well pleased, whenever he chose, with nary a claim on his time or attention.</p><p>Several developments allowed this respite besides the dwindling interest in Lance by magistrates out for blood. No cases awaited his eloquence in court for at least a fortnight. By coincidence his mistress had a week ago been most disloyal, giving him the excuse he had sought for some time to part with her.</p><p>That left him free of her too. Of attending on her. Of purchasing gifts. Of feeding her vanity. Of joining in little parties that she liked to hold that bored him more than he ever let her know.</p><p>It did, of course, also leave him free of a sexual companion. That was not a situation that he by nature welcomed, but he did not mind too much. Contemplating with whom to end his abstinence would give his forays out on the town an enlivening distraction.</p><p>He anticipated a glorious stretch of pointless activity. Several long rides in the country beckoned, following whim more than roads or maps. A stack of books like this one waited, too long unread. He could indulge in regular practice with sword and fists, to improve his prowess at fighting with both. And he looked forward to at least one good long debauch of drunkenness with old friends too long neglected.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Vickers&#x2019;s voice, right at his shoulder, surprised him. He had not heard Vickers return.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, there is a visitor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Throw him out, I told you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is not your brother. It is a woman. She says she has come on business. She says you were recommended to her.&#x201d;</p><p>Exhaling a sigh, Ives held out his palm.</p><p>&#x201c;She gave me no card, sir. I would have sent her on her way, but she would not indicate just who had recommended you, and the last time such an unnamed recommendation came your way it was from&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, quite right.&#x201d; Damnation. If someone, or even Someone, thought to interfere with the next fortnight by having him running around England on some mission or investigation, Someone was very much mistaken. Still, he should at least meet this woman and hear her out, so he could construct a good reason why he could not help her.</p><p>He stood, and looked down at himself. He wore a long banyan over his shirt and trousers. The notion of dressing again raised the devil in him. Hell, it was long past time to call at a lawyer&#x2019;s office, even if Someone recommended him. He would be too informal for a stranger, or for business, but he was hardly in a nightshirt. This woman would just have to forgive him his dishabille. With luck she would realize she had interfered with his evening, which she rudely had, and make quick work of whatever she wanted.</p><p>He walked to the office. She was probably a petitioner for some reform cause, or the relative of a friend looking for his advice on which solicitor to hire. Her mission this evening no doubt could have been completed more humanely by writing a letter.</p><p>He opened the door to his office, and immediately knew that his visitor had not been recommended by anyone significant, let alone <i>Someone</i> really important. Her plain gray dress marked her as a servant. He could not see one bit of adornment on either it or the dull green spencer buttoned high on her chest. The simplest bonnet he had seen in months covered her black hair and framed her face.</p><p>Eyes lowered, lost in her thoughts, she had not heard him. He considered stepping out just as silently, and telling Vickers to send her away. He placed one foot back to do so.</p><p>Just then she lifted a handkerchief to her eyes&#x2014;glittering eyes, he could not help but notice, with thick, black lashes that contrasted starkly with her pale skin. Radiant skin, as it happened, giving her face a notable presence, if he did say so, even if she was not a beautiful woman. Handsome, however, even if somewhat sharp featured.</p><p>She dabbed at tears. Her reserved expression crumbled under emotion.</p><p>He hated seeing women cry. Hated it. His easy sympathy had caused him nothing but trouble in the past too. Still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>He waited until she composed herself, then walked forward.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Padua sniffed, and not only to hold back the tears that the day tried to force on her. She also checked for the tenth time to discover if her garments smelled.</p><p>Newgate Prison reeked. The stench that London gave off seemed to concentrate in the old city, but Newgate smelled like the source of it all. She had never experienced anything like it. It remained in her nose, and she worried that it had permeated her clothing.</p><p>She sat rigidly on the chair the servant had pointed out. Her surroundings caused some trepidation. She had perhaps been rash in following the advice to seek out this lawyer. Probably so, considering the person who had given the advice had been a bawd incarcerated in the prison.</p><p>Normally, she would not take advice from a prostitute or a criminal. Yet when that woman called her over as she found her way out of the prison, and showed sympathy, she had not been herself. Just talking to someone eased her distress. After hearing her tale of woe, that woman advised she get a lawyer, and even provided the name of one who had aided a relative who was wrongly accused. Suddenly the prostitute appeared as an angel sent by Providence to offer guidance out of the Valley of Despair.</p><p>Now she awaited that lawyer&#x2019;s attendance. Not only a lawyer, but also a lord. She thought it odd that a lord was a lawyer. She would assume the bawd erred on that, except the servant here did not blink when she used the title in requesting an audience.</p><p>Now that she was here, she could believe the lord part. Although she sat in his chambers, this was no apartment, nor merely a set of offices. Rather she sat on the entry level of what appeared to be a new house facing Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields. There had been nothing to indicate that others lived or worked above. This lawyer had a good deal of money if this whole building was his home.</p><p>The mahogany furniture and expensive bookbindings said as much. Her feet rested half-submerged in the dense pile of the carpet on the floor. Her rump perched on a chair that must have cost many pounds. Real paintings decorated the walls, not engravings done after famous works of art.</p><p>His fees were probably very high. She doubted she could afford them. The bawd had guessed as much. <i>If you&#x2019;ve not the coin to pay him, he&#x2019;ll probably take other payment, dear. Them that works our side of the Old Bailey almost all do.</i></p><p>Could she agree to that? She recoiled from the idea. Then again, it would be no worse than the bargains most women struck in their lives. Had her mother not taught her that the loveless marriages to which most women were subjected were merely economic arrangements prettied up by legalities? Experience of the world had shown that view to be harsh, perhaps, but essentially accurate.</p><p>She closed her eyes, and immediately was back in the prison, peering into a cell full of men. The stench, the dirt, the ugly sounds all assaulted her senses again. Hopelessness and death reigned in Newgate Prison. No one would leave a loved one inside it, if she had the means to get him out.</p><p>Tears pooled in her eyes. She dabbed them away with her handkerchief, and fought for composure. She never cried, but this was not a normal day in so many ways.</p><p>&#x201c;You asked to see me.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice jolted her out of her reverie and drew her attention to the man suddenly standing ten feet in front of her.</p><p>Oh, dear. Goodness. He was not what she expected. Not at all.</p><p>She had pictured a man of middle years with gray hair and spectacles and a face wizened with experience. He would wear dark coats and a crisp cravat and be accompanied by a clerk or two.</p><p>Instead the man assessing her&#x2014;there was no other word for the way his gaze took her in&#x2014;could be no older than thirty or so. He possessed classical features and fashionable locks of dark brown hair of an enviable hue.

A crisp breeze poured in.</p><p>She felt her face burning.</p><p>&#x201c;Please, do not be embarrassed. The prison is a fetid place,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I had a coat that had to be burned after I wore it there one summer day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is not only fetid, but horrible in every way. The conditions are disgraceful. The inmates are wretched.&#x201d;</p><p>He settled his tall body into a chair near hers. He sat in it like a king might sit on a throne. His arms rested along the tops of its sides, and his hands hung in front of its carving. &#x201c;Have you come to request a donation, perhaps to further a campaign to improve those conditions? I will contribute, but I must warn you that yours is a noble yet futile quest. People tend not to worry overmuch if criminals are not comfortable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not here to ask for a charitable donation, although someday I hope to have the time to devote to such good causes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A budding reformer, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is much in our society that could use some reform.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As there has been in every society down through time.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, dear, he was one of those. The kind who saw no point in trying to better the present because such efforts in the past had failed. &#x201c;I know history, sir. I have received a liberal education. With our superior knowledge, I think we can be more enlightened than our forefathers.&#x201d;</p><p>He resettled himself in that chair, and angled his head. &#x201c;I would ask which reforms you want to see first, but let me guess instead.&#x201d; His gaze scanned her from head to toe. &#x201c;Workers&#x2019; rights. Educational reform.&#x201d; He scanned again. &#x201c;Universal suffrage, including the vote for women. If you are educated, you would not like being denied a right enjoyed by others who have no more training of their mental faculties than you have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your conclusion is accurate. However, my reasons are less elevated. I simply believe that since there are many men who now vote who are stupid and ignorant, there can be no logic in denying the right to any others, stupid or ignorant though they might be as well.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed lightly. An appealing laugh. Quiet. Warming. His eyes showed new depths. &#x201c;I do not think I have ever heard it said that baldly before. Like a wily math tutor, you have insisted that a different equation be solved, one that puts me at a disadvantage should I want to disagree.&#x201d;</p><p>His insight with that math tutor comment unnerved her. How had they veered onto this topic? &#x201c;My opinions do not signify, of course. My original point was that not everyone in that prison is a criminal, so the suffering there cannot be excused.&#x201d;</p><p>He offered that half smile again, no more. &#x201c;Since you do not want money, and you do not want to discuss reforms, perhaps you will explain what you do want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want your eloquence and skill to help my father, who has been so affected by prison that he is too weak to help himself.

Your entire world can look very different, depending on which one you choose to attend to. One conversation is rational, calm, and reasoned. The other is emotional, impulsive, and hasty. Chronic stress raises the volume of the second and mutes the first.<br><br> A Prefrontal Executive<br><br> Your intelligent brain is like a giant corporation with a multitude of departments and subdepartments. An unimaginable amount of information passes through it and must be appropriately processed. The corporation's aim is to adapt your behavior to reap maximal benefits from the environment you are in. At the head of your corporation sits the chief executive officer, who coordinates the corporation's machinery and decides which departments should be accentuated and which should be toned down. This process must be able to adapt to changing circumstances. If the CEO orchestrates the corporation with wisdom and precision, it will likely thrive.<br><br> At the front of your brain, behind your forehead, sits a region known as the prefrontal cortex. It plays a central role in executive control and behaves, with collaborative assistance from others, like a CEO.<br><br> In every situation, it carefully assesses your terrain and formulates the best possible strategy for navigating through it. It modulates and controls activity across your brain's various departments to create as favorable a climate as possible for you to accomplish what you are doing. For example, if you are trying to read a long e-mail in the middle of a hectic, noisy office, it coordinates networks so the noise is muted and the distractions emanating from your surroundings are dimmed, so that you may focus.<br><br> Like any great executive, it has some special talents. It gathers as much information as it can from your present situation and holds on to it as working memory. Your working memory lets your prefrontal cortex relate what is happening now with what just happened a moment ago, so it can predict what will happen next and modify its strategy for you, if needed. Your prefrontal cortex also controls the spotlight of your attention and decides where that spotlight should be beamed. It scrutinizes data coming in from multiple channels to decide what deserves attention and what does not. The scrutiny takes place at many levels within the prefrontal cortex and includes analyses of analyses as well as consultation with long-term memory stores via a region of your brain known as the hippocampus. If your thoughts and sensations are unimportant and irrelevant to your task at hand, your prefrontal cortex lowers their volume so your attention does not waver from what you are doing.<br><br> Your prefrontal cortex, in association with other networks, strategically plans, reasons, regulates behavior, makes decisions, and exerts top-down control over other parts of your brain as you navigate toward a goal. Through trial, error, and intelligence it learns to assign an appropriate behavior to a given set of circumstances and to improve upon that behavior as soon as new information presents itself. It is always learning and trying to upgrade its intelligence.<br><br> This puts your prefrontal cortex in a state of intense activity as new networks form and change and new connections between brain cells (synapses) materialize and weaken. There are an unimaginable number of synapses within your brain, and these synapses shift and change all the time in a state of heavy flux. The evolving change in the strength and activity of synapses is known as synaptic plasticity. When we adapt to a new situation and the brain rewires itself to cope, it relies heavily on synaptic plasticity.<br><br> The Rational Regulation of Emotion<br><br> Your emotional instinct is a valuable tool for navigating the nuances of today's urban environment because your threats tend to come from social interactions, rather than from wild animals. When these threats set off negative emotions in your mind, they may bypass careful analysis by your prefrontal cortex, to save you time. This short circuit prevents you from filtering out false alarms.<br><br> The brain circuitry that processes your emotions is extensive and includes both positive and negative feedback loops. Many of these loops are modulated by parts of your prefrontal cortex. If your prefrontal cortex decides it is in your best interest to stay on high alert for possible threats coming from your environment, it may raise the volume of your emotional response. If it decides your emotions are proving distracting to what you are doing, it may mute your emotional response and shift the spotlight of your attention away to a worthier target. If it malfunctions, your emotional response may be disproportionate to what your situation warrants.<br><br> One of the main players in your emotional network is the amygdala. The amygdala carries out a quick preliminary scan of the information coming in from your environment and then sends signals to various other parts of your brain including the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex, in turn, sends signals to your amygdala. Parts of it may promote or demote its activity depending on the other information it has gathered. During emotional conflict, for instance, parts of the prefrontal cortex appear to "restrain" the amygdala. One other key team member in your emotional network is the (mostly ventral) hippocampus, which collaborates with your amygdala.<br><br> The prefrontal cortex plays an essential role in conducting the orchestra of your brain so your response to the world you find yourself in is always rational and reasoned. If the regulatory skills of your prefrontal cortex are hampered, your response to your environment may be irrational and inappropriate and your experience of your life will change. Brain scan images of people suffering from chronic occupational stress or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show signs of defective prefrontal regulation of emotion and behavior. Not being able to down-regulate negative emotions is associated with burnout. <br><br> If your emotions are not regulated, negative emotions may surface easily and take over your mind. You may view the world with a negative bias, dwelling on its negative features and remembering negative experiences more than positive ones. Your unregulated perspective may make the world feel uncertain and unpredictable, so you constantly feel on edge and anxious. Each of these intense negative emotions feeds back into your brain's emotion networks, amplifying and propagating their activity.<br><br> Here is an example of how the presence or absence of good emotional regulation can give you a drastically different experience of the same event.<br><br> Life through an Emotional Lens:<br><br> Your usually cheerful boss did not smile back at you this morning. You arrive at your desk and start wondering why. You have poor control over your emotions, so your mind creates worst case scenarios as you interpret everything you see and hear with a strong negative bias. You feel anxious and guilty. You worry that your boss has some bad news to share with you, in light of rumors of cuts in your company's budget. You notice others around you discreetly smiling to themselves and wonder if they are laughing at you because your sacking is an open story. You have bills to pay and that new mortgage. You panic.<br><br> Life through a Rational Lens:<br><br> Your usually cheerful boss did not smile back at you this morning. As you rationally try to understand why, your prefrontal cortex and hippocampus carefully revisit the scene and go through their inventory of past experiences. They come upon a distant memory buried in your mind, of someone gossiping about your boss's sudden interest in Botox therapy. Thinking back, you now remember how the edges of her eyes twitched while her mouth and forehead remained frozen. Looking around the office floor, you notice your colleagues trying (and failing) to keep a straight face. You smile, too, at the hilarity of the situation.<br><br> Your Autopilot Response System<br><br> Your autopilot nerve network, the autonomic nervous system, rapidly carries signals from your brain to your body. Its two halves, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, which work together to keep your body's engine running smoothly, stay permanently switched on. When their activities need adjusting, their gain or tone is changed without turning them off completely. For instance, sympathetic input to your heart raises your heart rate whereas parasympathetic input lowers it. If your heart needs to beat faster, the tone of the sympathetic input is raised and the tone of the parasympathetic input is reduced, but both continue to provide input to the heart.<br><br> When your body experiences stress, your brain sets off two distinct chain reactions. The first chain involves your fast-acting autonomic nervous system whose two halves work in opposition during stress. Your sympathetic tone rapidly rises and your parasympathetic tone falls and this chain culminates in the release of epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and in a range of physiological responses such as rapid breathing, a quickened pulse, and heightened alertness. The second chain of events begins in your hypothalamus and ends with the adrenal gland releasing the stress hormone cortisol. The two chains interact and feed forward and back upon each other until the stressful moment is passed. At this point, your parasympathetic tone rises and your sympathetic tone falls. Your parasympathetic network becomes more active as you relax and your sympathetic network becomes more active when you are stressed.<br><br> Your amygdala and its close collaborators (known as the Central Autonomic Network) are intricately connected to the circuitry of your stress response. This explains why things that affect you emotionally can rapidly trigger a stress response. Experiences that elicit intense negative emotions can increase your sympathetic tone whether they come from the world around you or from the thoughts floating through your mind. If you experience many such emotional triggers, or if you cannot regain control over your emotions quickly after they have been aroused, you will be prone to frequent bouts of stress and your sympathetic tone may stay unnecessarily raised.<br><br> Your brain ignites a stress response when it thinks you are being threatened. That threat may be physical or emotional. The stress that we tend to experience most of the time in today's industrialized, urbanized world takes the form of psychosocial stress which acts through your emotional reactivity. Since your prefrontal cortex regulates your emotional reactivity, it plays a vital role in your susceptibility to stress.<br><br> Its critical role becomes apparent when you find yourself in an unexpected, stressful situation when it reins in your stress reactivity, regulates your emotions and keeps your attention fixed on the task at hand. If it does its job well, it softens the stressful impact of the situation. In the moments that immediately follow a stressful experience, your prefrontal cortex shifts your attention away from the inflammatory thoughts simmering in your mind, so you can recover as quickly as possible and move on. If it is not able to regulate your emotions, your recovery is slow and may even be incomplete.<br><br> A Word on Terminology<br><br> The network of brain cells that process emotions is vast and complex and I will be referring to it as the emotional brain, so as not to overburden you with too many technical terms. Similarly, the rational brain refers to the networks in the prefrontal cortex that are involved in goal-directed decision-making and behavior, emotional regulation, working memory and learning, and attentional control, and are generally responsible for making sure you respond to your environment as rationally and wisely as possible. This term also includes networks in the (mostly dorsal) hippocampus, a key player in learning and memory, as well as in some other regions that may collaborate with the prefrontal cortex. The terms emotional brain and rational brain in the context of this book refer to what the networks do in the context of psychosocial stress. In reality, the brain is not anatomically divided into rational and emotional sections, and emotion and cognition are tightly interwoven and served by overlapping circuits.<br><br> Acute and Chronic Stress<br><br> If you imagine the brain as an orchestra conducted by the prefrontal cortex, the melody being played is synchronous and balanced most of the time. During acute, uncontrollable stress, the conductor, your prefrontal cortex, gives the floor to one instrumental section that emerges out of the harmonious symphony and powerfully dominates the stage. This section processes your negative emotions. After the stressful experience is over, the prefrontal cortex shifts attention away from this section and the soothing harmony resumes.<br><br> The brain of an adult human alters in response to what is asked of it. It rapidly adapts to meet changing demands so it can thrive in a dynamic environment. If its experience of stress is no&nbsp; longer acute but chronic, it may change its connectivity and structure to adapt to this new setting. The temporary weakening of prefrontal control over emotions and behavior now persists and dysregulated emotional behavior lingers on. The change in connectivity makes the imbalance between rationality and emotional reactivity long-standing instead of temporary. Many of the manifestations of chronic stress, from impaired emotional regulation to changes in motivation, behavior, and the ability to feel pleasure, may be the result of diminished prefrontal control.<br><br> There are many routes by which chronic stress can progressively weaken prefrontal control networks. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are both in a state of constant flux and they rely heavily on intense synaptic plasticity. Any process that obstructs this activity, such as chronic stress, interferes with their functioning. Interestingly, the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are also vulnerable to damage from aging and degenerative diseases such as dementia.<br><br> Brain cells in the prefrontal cortex (known as pyramidal cells) have a shape that resembles a tree. They have branches that extend outward (known as dendritic branches). These branches are involved in synapse formation. Chronic stress makes these branches regress. It also affects cell-to-cell communication and hinders coordinated electrical oscillations between brain cells, which are vital for information processing. These effects compromise the ability of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus to do their job properly, and regulatory control may suffer.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br> The poorly regulated emotional brain may now react more easily. While dendritic branches may regress in the prefrontal cortex, they may grow in the amygdala. A recent study has shown an inverse relationship between feeling chronically stressed and the size of the prefrontal cortex. Each small bout of acute stress a chronically stressed brain encounters may feel more intense and prolonged than it otherwise would.<br><br> We become what we behold.

This collection of 107 chapters encompasses a wide variety of subjects, originally inspired by his study of Latin classics, and later by the lives of the leading figures of his time. Michel de Montaigne saw the most basic elements of man as variety and unpredictability, and this idea permeates the entire work, even as he explores a myriad of topics, including theology, philosophy, law, fame, memory, death, and his own daily schedule. The longest essay, entitled &#x2018;Apology for Raymond Sebond,&#x2019; contains his most famous quote: &#x201c;What do I know?&#x201d; This perhaps embodies the spirit of the entire volume, for it reflects both the inquisitory search for intellectual knowledge as well as the more personal anecdotal quality of a work that has had an enduring impact on both French and English literature for hundreds of years.

Born in 1842, Ida began tending the light at age fifteen after her father, the keeper of the light, was disabled by a stroke. When her father died in 1872, Ida&#x2019;s mother assumed the role of lighthouse keeper but Ida continued to do the work. Then when her mother died in 1879, Ida was officially appointed to the job, where she remained until her death in 1911.&nbsp;</p><p>Ida is credited with saving at least eighteen lives during her nearly forty years on the tiny island in Newport Harbor. She became famous nationwide in the late 1860s after one of&nbsp; her daring rescues, and the town of Newport celebrated her on Independence Day&nbsp;1869. In 1924, the Rhode Island legislature officially changed the name of Lime Rock Lighthouse to Ida Lewis Lighthouse. In 1928, all but a portion of Lime Rock used for the light tower was sold to yachtsmen who preserved the historic house and established the Ida Lewis Yacht Club. In 1995, a Coast Guard buoy tender was named for her. </p>Lenore Skomal is an author and career journalist with more than 25 years experience in all forms of media, including newspaper, radio broadcasting, the Internet and television.

Tilman: The Seven Mountain-Travel Books</i>, an earlier omnibus, and this companion volume deals with his equally enthralling sailing adventures.<br>When he bought the pilot cutter "Mischief" in 1954, it was not with the intention of retiring from mountaineering, but to use the sea for access to remote mountains in high latitudes. Over the next twenty-two years "Mischief" and her successors saw regular service in distant waters, and their owner developed a whole new technique and tradition of amphibious mountaineering. His seafaring technique, like that of his mountaineering, was based on simplicity, using well-tried methods and navigational equipment that was essentially the same as that used by James Cook. He maintained that the only worthwhile innovations made in small ships in the last hundred years were the Diesel engine and Terylene rope. His seamanship was characterized by the same intelligence, cool judgment and masterly skill that had made his mountaineering exploits famous. He became an excellent navigator, with an approach more like that of a merchant sailing ship's master than a modern racing yachtsman's. The object was to arrive, not to win a race, and his ships and crews were carefully nursed through severe conditions without strain or fuss.<br>The eight books collected haere are humorous, learned, devastatingly candid, and packed with information. They recount voyages to the Southern Oceans where he visited Patagonia, the Crozets, Kerguelen, Heard Island and the South Shetlands. No less important were his many trips to Greenland as well as forays to Sptizbergen, Baffin Island and other areas above the Arctic Circle. The mountaineering highlights of his seafaring career were the crossing of the Patagonian ice cap, the crossing of Bylot Island, and the ascent of Big Ben on Heard Island, where although Tilman was not in the summit party, he contributed more than any of them to the success of the expedition.<br>Not all of his voyages were successful or enjoyable. A valued crew member was lost overboard during one venture. There were the sad losses of his cutters, "Mischief" and "Sea Breeze," and other occasions when crew members, unable to match Tilman's persistence, decided to desert or mutiny.<br>Most of his crews were made of sterner stuff. They were rewarded with good fellowship and humor, the opportunity of learning seamanship and mountaineering from a great teacher, and a chance to see what may be done in rough waters and heavy ice in a little, old, unstrengthened ship.<br>Some managed to join him on more than one voyage, including the resourceful Simon Richardson, in whose boat "En Avant", Tilman, Richardson and their crew disappeared after leaving Rio de Janeiro for Port Stanley in November 1977. What happened is a mystery but the passage to South America had been a happy one. The loss of six enterprising young men was tragic, but for Tilman at least, it was a sad but curiously fitting end, one last voyage in the best of good company.<br></p><p>According to David Roberts, <strong>H.W. TILMAN</strong> was "the best expedition writer�&#x20ac;&#x3a9;just as he was arguably the century's best explorer-mountaineer, whittling his whole life to a sunny vagabondage that held him in its thrall even as he sailed off into the Antarctic Ocean in his eightieth year." More prosaically, Tilman was a coffee planter turned adventurer who climbed extensively in Africa and the Himalaya; he also served in both World Wars. In 1934, Tilman and Eric Shipton pioneered a route to Nanda Devi's 'Inner Sanctuary.' This was followed, in 1936, by a first ascent by Tilman and N. E. Odell of Nanda Devi, reputedly the most outstanding mountaineering success of the pre-Second World War era. Tilman was next was appointed the leader of the 1938 (British) Everest Expedition, on which he reached more than 27,000 feet (without supplementary oxygen). His Everest expedition was marked by the small size and close-knit quality of the participants, the Shipton/Tilman belief being that "any worthwhile expedition can be planned on the back of an envelope." The W.L. Gore Shipton/Tilman Grant is named for the two adventurers.</p><h2>Handmade Culture: Raku Potters, Patrons, and Tea Practitioners in Japan</h2><p><p><i>Handmade Culture</i> is the first comprehensive and cohesive study in any language to examine Raku, one of Japan&#x2019;s most famous arts and a pottery technique practiced around the world. More than a history of ceramics, this innovative work considers four centuries of cultural invention and reinvention during times of both political stasis and socioeconomic upheaval. It combines scholarly erudition with an accessible story through its lively and lucid prose and its generous illustrations. The author&#x2019;s own experiences as the son of a professional potter and a historian inform his unique interdisciplinary approach, manifested particularly in his sensitivity to both technical ceramic issues and theoretical historical concerns. <br><br><i>Handmade Culture</i> makes ample use of archaeological evidence, heirloom ceramics, tea diaries, letters, woodblock prints, and gazetteers and other publications to narrate the compelling history of Raku, a fresh approach that sheds light not only on an important traditional art from Japan, but on the study of cultural history itself.</p></p><p><b>Morgan Pitelka</b> is associate professor of Asian studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Morgan Pitelka&#x2019;s <i>Handmade Culture,</i> an interpretive history of the raku tradition, is both informative and innovative. It begins with the tradition&#x2019;s local origin in late-sixteenth-century Kyoto, traces its emergence as a distinctive national discourse, and closes with an account of its survival in modern times. Pitelka&#x2019;s attention to raku&#x2019;s broader social and economic contexts, inspired by Pierre Bourdieu&#x2019;s theory of cultural production, offers a new approach to Japanese art history. -- <b>Samuel Yamashita</b>, Pomona College</p><h2>How Life Moves: Explorations in Meaning and Body Awareness</h2><p>This comprehensive movement program uses the story of biological evolution as a tool to increase strength, flexibility, and body awareness. Readers learn to "unlearn" inherited bodily habits by embodying the many forms that life has expressed on Earth&#x2014;from the single cell to the human being&#x2014;and shifting their perception. Through this evolutionary movement, the body's native intelligence is revived and new movements can be learned, enabling the body to overcome chronic musculoskeletal complaints such as lower back, shoulder, and neck pain, and to meet whatever challenges it is faced with.</p><p>Caryn McHose has taught creative movement for over thirty-five years.

He was a heretic, a reformer, and an outlaw of the Holy Roman Empire. &nbsp;<br><br>In the 16th century, nun Katharina von Bora&#x2019;s fate fell no further than the Abbey. Until she read the writings of Martin Luther. His sweeping Catholic church reformation&#x2014;condemning a cloistered life and promoting the goodness of marriage&#x2014;awakened her desire for everything she&#x2019;d been forbidden.

So when an intelligence agency offers her a luxury Nile cruise if she&#39;ll help solve a murder and stop a heist of Egyptian antiquities, all 5&#39;11&#34; of her takes the plunge. Vicky suspects the authorities really want her to lead them to her missing lover, the art thief and master of disguises she knows only as &#34;Sir John Smythe.&#34; And right in the shadow of the Sphinx she spots him. . . with his new flame. Vicky is so furious at this romantic stab-in-the-back, not to mention the sudden arrival of her meddling boss, Herr Dr. Schmidt, that she may overlook a danger as old as the pharaohs and as unchanging. . . a criminal who hides behind a mask of charm while moving in for the kill.</p><p>Elizabeth Peters was born and brough up in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. in Egyptology from the University of Chicago's famed Oriental Institute. Peters was named Grand Master at the inaugural Anthony Awards in 1986 and Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America in 1998. In 2003, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Malice Domestic Convention.

She lives in western Maryland. Visit her website at: www.ameliapeabody.com.The most noteworthy feature of this Vicky Bliss mystery is the breathless, almost frantic, pace at which it&#39;s read. Actress Turner is probably trying to capture Vicky&#39;s youth, impetuousness and hair-trigger emotions, but in the process she confuses the listener, blunts dramatic moments and mispronounces &#34;ornithologist.&#34; To her credit, she manages several accents, from heavy German to light British, fairly well. Vicky is an art expert hired to foil a plot to rob the Cairo Museum. One of the suspects turns out to be her long-time lover, art forger John Smythe. By the time everything gets judiciously and romantically sorted out, the listener has gotten somewhat adjusted to the rapid-fire dialogue. Snippets of Roy Acuff&#39;s country music seem out of place in a story set mainly in Egypt, even if one of the songs is &#34;Night Train to Memphis.&#34; Those whose ears do well in overdrive might like this production; otherwise, opt for Barbara Rosenblat&#39;s more tempered reading for Recorded Books.

In this pathbreaking book, Charles L. Briggs and Clara Mantini-Briggs relay the nightmarish and difficult experiences of doctors, patients, parents, local leaders, healers, and epidemiologists; detail how journalists first created a smoke screen, then projected the epidemic worldwide; discuss the Ch�vez government's hesitant and sometimes ambivalent reactions; and narrate the eventual diagnosis of bat-transmitted rabies. The book provides a new framework for analyzing how the uneven distribution of rights to produce and circulate knowledge about health are wedded at the hip with health inequities. By recounting residents' quest to learn why their children died and documenting their creative approaches to democratizing health, the authors open up new ways to address some of global health's most intractable problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Charles L. Briggs is Alan Dundes Distinguished Professor in the Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, and the author or coauthor of ten books.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clara Mantini-Briggs, a Venezuelan public health physician, was the National Coordinator of the Dengue Fever Program in Venezuela's Ministry of Health and is a Lecturer in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. They are coauthors of <i>Stories in the Time of Cholera: Racial Profiling during a Medical Nightmare</i>.&nbsp;"<i>Tell Me Why My Children Died</i> is a product of intrepid inquiry, original analytical work, and, above all, deep respect and care for the most vulnerable in the Lower Delta. This book is a pathbreaking contribution to the anthropology of expert knowledge and health inequality, and a powerfully crafted field guide for a global health humanities."&nbsp; -- Jo�o Biehl, author of, <i>Vita: Life in a Zone of Social Abandonment</i></p><h2>Fran</h2><p>For the past 20 years or so, Jim Woodring's beloved trilobular chuckbuster Frank has enjoyed one mindbending catastrophe after another in the treacherous embrace of The Unifactor, the land into which he was born and from which escape seemed neither desirable nor likely. And then, abruptly, in 2011's acclaimed Congress of the Animals (the second Woodring original graphic novel, following Weathercraft) Frank did leave the Unifactor for uncharted lands beyond where, after a string of trials, he acquired a soulmate named Fran. This development raised far more questions than it answered. Would Frank become placid and domesticated? Would he be jilted? Would he turn out to be a dreadful cad? Would he become a downtrodden and exhausted paterfamilias staring vacantly into the dimming fire of life as obnoxious grandchildren pulled his peglike ears and stole his porridge? The answers to these fruitless speculations and many more are delivered in a devastatingly unpredictable fashion in Fran, which is in effect part two of Congress of the Animals. Fans of Frank, connoisseurs of bizarre romance, and spelunkers in the radiant depths of graphic metaphysical psychodrama will want to add this singular cartoon adventure story to their lifetime reading list. <br></p><p>Jim Woodring lives on Vashon Island in Washington State&#x2019;s Puget Sound with his wife, Mary. The recipient of numerous rewards&#x2015;including a Genius Award&#x2015;he is an animator and a fine artist as well as a cartoonist.In Congress of the Animals (2011), Woodring&#x2019;s longtime protagonist, the childlike feline Frank, left the Unifactor&#x2014;the surreal realm in which he and his friends and foes reside&#x2014;and explored an equally strange new world where he seemed to have found his soul mate, a female doppelg�nger named Fran, who happily returned home with Frank. But the course of true love runs no more smoothly in the Unifactor than it does anywhere else, and in a foolish argument, Frank childishly drives Fran away. Immediately regretting his rash behavior, Frank sets out to find her with the help of his loyal pets, Pupshaw and Pushpaw. Frank&#x2019;s quest takes him through dazzlingly rendered hallucinogenic landscapes and to encounters with bizarrely menacing beings, as Woodring&#x2019;s fans have come to count on. But the heightened emotional stakes are new: Frank&#x2019;s followers have watched him shrug off violent treatment with the resilience of a Warner Bros. cartoon character, but the loss of Fran seems more devastating than the worst punishment he&#x2019;s received at the hands of the devilish Whim. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>C.S.

When readers enter such textual worlds, which are often strange and complex, they are confronted with theological claims. With this in mind, the purpose of the Interpreting Biblical Texts series is to help serious readers in their experience of reading and interpreting by providing guides for their journeys into textual worlds. The controlling perspective is expressed in the operative word of the title--interpreting. The primary focus of the series is not so much on the world behind the texts or out of which the texts have arisen as on the worlds created by the texts in their engagement with readers. </p> <p></p> <p>Although these books of the prophets are based upon the careers and experiences of some of the most talented and provocative individuals of their times, the books must be read first as literature.&nbsp; Each book displays its own unique organization, literary characteristics, and theological outlook in presenting the prophets.&nbsp; In the case of Jeremiah, interpreters must even consider two distinctive forms of the book in the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint.&nbsp; By guiding the reader through the literary structure and language of each of the prophetic books as well as the social roles of the individual prophets, this volume opens the reader to greater understanding and appreciation of the prophets of Israel and Judah.</p> <p>"Fact packed and crystal clear, Marvin Sweeney&#x2019;s Interpreting Biblical Texts: The Prophetic Literature invites readers to tour the landscape of ancient Israel&#x2019;s Latter Prophets corpus.&nbsp; Sweeney serves as a first-rate guide, equipping readers with basic knowledge to grasp, and grapple with, the literary legacies of the canonical prophets.

The house is <i>Le Margherite,</i> a home where the sprawling cast of <i>The City and the House</i> is welcome. At the center of this lush epistolary novel is Lucrezia, mother of five and lover of many. Among her lovers&#x2014;and perhaps the father of one of her children&#x2014;is Giuseppe. After the sale of <i>Le Margherite,</i> the characters wander aimlessly as if in search of a lost paradise.<br><br> What was once rooted, local, and specific has become general and common, a matter of strangers and of pointless arrivals and departures. And at the edge of the novel are people no longer able to form any sustained or sustaining relationships. Here, once again, Ginzburg pulls us through a thrilling and true exploration of the disintegration of family in modern society. She handles a host of characters with a deft touch and her typical impressionist hand, and offers a story full of humanity, passion, and keen perception.</p><p><b>Natalia Ginzburg</b> was born in Palermo, Italy in 1916. She was an Italian author whose work explored family relationships, politics during and after the Fascist years and World War II, and philosophy. She wrote novels, short stories and essays, for which she received the Strega Prize and Bagutta Prize. Modest and intensely reserved, Ginzburg never shied away from the traumas of history, whether writing about the Turin of her childhood, the Abruzzi countryside or contemporary Rome�all the while approaching those traumas only indirectly, through the mundane details and catastrophes of personal life. Most of her works were also translated into English and published in the United Kingdom and United States. She wrote acclaimed translations of both Proust and Flaubert into Italian. She died in Rome in 1991.<br><br><b>Cynthia Zarin</b>&nbsp;is the author of five books of poetry, most recently,&nbsp;<i>Orbit&nbsp;</i>(Knopf, 2017) &nbsp;as well as five books for children, and a collection of&nbsp;essays,&nbsp;<i>An Enlarged Heart: A&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<i>Personal History</i>&nbsp;(Knopf,2013). A long time contributor to&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>, she teaches at Yale. &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Praise for <i>The City and the House</i>:</b><br><br> "'The City and the House' is a fine book, subtle and shrewd." &#x2014;<i>LA Times</i><br><br> "A brief, deft epistolary novel . . . she etches a picture of the bonds that are cast between us, bonds that prove surprisingly tough for seeming so fragile. A writer of understated mastery who deserves an American following." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> "The city is Rome; the house, Le Margherite, a villa in the country outside Rome. Ginzburg's novel consists of a series of letters mainly between Giuseppe, a widowed writer living in Rome; Lucrezia, his ex-lover, who lives at Le Margherite with her husband Piero and their children; Giuseppe's son, Alberico, a homosexual filmmaker; Giuseppe's brother Ferruccio, a professor of biology at Princeton; his wife Anne Marie, also a biologist at Princeton; and Anne Marie's daughter Chantal. In the first letter, Giuseppe discusses his decision to move to America: "I am very happy to be leaving. . . . I am also very sorry to be leaving. I think I shall miss certain people and places I'm strongly attached to." The reader, too, will miss these crazy, mixed-up, very human, exasperating, and endearing characters. Highly recommended." &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "This warm-hearted novel is an excellent example of the distinguished Italian novelist and essayist's art." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br><b>Praise for Natalia Ginzburg's work</b><br><br> &#x201c;One of the Great Italian Writers of the 20th Century.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br> "Clarity, precision and wit mark the work of Natalia Ginzburg." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Ginzburg [was] famous for her ability to conjure up a mixed emotional atmosphere, poignant yet unsentimental."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> "A glowing light of modern Italian literature . . . Ginzburg's magic is the utter simplicity of her prose, suddenly illuminated by one word that makes a lightning streak of a plain phrase. . . . As direct and clean as if it were carved in stone, it yet speaks thoughts of the heart." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "I wish more people would read the Italian writer Natalia Ginzburg." &#x2014; Mary Gordon, <i>Mother Jones</i><br><br> "Natalia Ginzburg must surely be one of literature's most provocative and moving writers." &#x2014; <i>Elle</i> magazine<br><br> "Realistic, anchored by vivifying detail, crowded with wonderfully vibrant characters, luminous with deep feeling, responsiveness, and sympathy." &#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "Ginzburg draws her readers into her deceptively charming essays with cascades of alluring, everyday detail, then stealthily broaches moral questions of great weight and complexity. Wryly witty, acutely observant, and unfailingly valiant, Ginzburg is a revelation, a spur, and a joy." &#x2014; <i>Booklist</i></p><h2>The Good Living Guide to Country Skills: Wisdom for Growing Your Own Food, Raising Animals, Canning and Fermenting, and More</h2><p>Gehring&#x2019;s books on country living have sold more than 500,000 copies.

Until now, however, the novel that launched Edwardson?s critically acclaimed Erik Winter series has never been available in the United States. With a new series translator who fully captures Edwardson?s signature atmospheric style, <i>Death Angels</i> is America?s introduction to Sweden?s youngest Chief Inspector as he teams up with Scotland Yard to solve the mysterious parallel killings of young British and Swedish tourists. Richly evocative of mid-nineties South London and Gothenburg, Sweden, <i>Death Angels</i> is a brilliant opening to a mesmerizing series that has become a phenomenon in international crime fiction.</p><p>�ke Edwardson is one of Scandinavia&#x2019;s most successful crime writers. He has won numerous awards, including the Swedish Academy of Crime Writers&#x2019; Award three times.Edwardson's middling fourth police procedural to be made available in the U.S. (after 2007's <i>Frozen Tracks</i>) lacks the sophisticated plot and characters that mark the work of such other Swedish crime authors as Helene Tursten and Stieg Larsson. Chief Insp. Erik Winter joins forces with his British counterparts after a series of brutal murders of young men in London and his own city of Gothenburg. The killer, dubbed Hitchcock, appears to have filmed the butchery, as evidenced by traces of a tripod stand in the victims' blood. The trail naturally leads into the seamy world of snuff films, but the big break comes from a burglar who noticed some blood-stained clothing in an apartment he broke into. The smooth translation is perhaps the book's best feature. Edwardson has won the Swedish Academy of Crime Writers' Award three times. <i>(Sept. 29)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They alert the police, but not before Reinhardt, to Kristine&#x2019;s horror, kneels down and takes photographs of the dead child with his cell phone. Inspectors Konrad Sejer and Jakob Skarre begin to make inquiries in the little town of Solberglia. But then another boy disappears, and an explanation seems more remote than ever.

Her recent honors include a Gumshoe Award and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize for mystery/thriller. She lives in Norway.</p><br>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Maureen Corrigan It's a mark of Karin Fossum's writerly magnificence that even though her latest crime novel, "The Water's Edge," revolves around what is at the moment the most recycled plot in both mystery and literary fiction -- a missing and/or murdered child -- it still manages to be an intelligent thriller. That sounds like a backhanded compliment, but if you get sent as many review copies as I do (upward of 100 books a week) and see that roughly one out of every 10 has something to do with dead children, you develop a knee-jerk prejudice against any book that hawks this grisly subject. One thing, though, that immediately sets Fossum's fine mystery apart from other, merely sensational variations on this story line is its self-consciousness. Fossum's detectives, Inspector Konrad Sejer and his second in command, Jacob Skarre, intermittently pause in their investigations to ponder their own fascination with horror. Maybe their ruminative personalities owe something to the chill, dark Norwegian climes where they operate. Whatever the cause, loopy-but-philosophical conversations like this one (which takes place immediately after the discovery of the first victim, 7-year-old Jonas Lowe) are common throughout "The Water's Edge," as well as throughout the five preceding novels in the Sejer series: " 'Why are we so drawn to the death of others?' Skarre asked. . . . " 'I'm not drawn to death,' [Sejer] said. 'Are you?' " 'But we chose this profession,' Skarre said. 'The murder of Jonas is a dreadful event. Others could have dealt with it, and we could be doing a much nicer job. . . . You could have been a pastry chef. You could have spent your whole day decorating cream cakes. . . .' " 'I could never have been a pastry chef,' Sejer declared. 'Cream cakes are pretty to look at, but they have no stories to tell.' " The cosmic mystery of why nearly everybody -- our fictional detectives, as well as we, their flesh-and-blood readers -- is drawn to stories of death is one that "The Water's Edge" implicitly investigates. In the opening pages, a middle-aged couple go for their regular Sunday walk to a wooded lake and stumble upon Jonas's body. Shaken, the wife, Kristine, sinks down by a tree. Her husband, Reinhardt, takes out his cellphone and calls the police. Then, Kristine notices that Reinhardt has knelt by the corpse and, for a moment, she thinks her normally gruff husband is crying. But the truth is more dismaying: Reinhardt is taking photos of poor Jonas with his cellphone. We readers share Kristine's revulsion at the same time that the scene makes us aware of our own curiosity about the details of Jonas's murder. After all, even if we're not taking the photographs, we're looking, aren't we? As "The Water's Edge" explores the voyeurism inherent to crime fiction, it also tells two absorbing stories. The first focuses on the detective work generated by Jonas's death and, subsequently, the disappearance of another boy from the same area. Like the well-ripened queens of psychological suspense to whom she is inevitably compared -- Ruth Rendell and P.D. James -- the younger Fossum charts this excursion into the unthinkable with poetic restraint. In describing the detectives' fruitless search for clues to Jonas's murderer, Fossum's omniscient narrator sounds like the voice of a Norse god, stoically commenting on human frailty: "His mother's warnings had been brushed aside, barely noticeable, like the trace of a feather across a cheek and Jonas had discarded his stick and got into a stranger's car. People are unpredictable creatures, they invent rules which they break incessantly and they follow impulses which they later cannot explain." The second (and, to my mind, even more spellbinding) story here chronicles the rapid erosion of Kristine's and Reinhardt's marriage in the wake of their grim discovery. The girlish Kristine, we learn, has always lived in what Emily Dickinson called a marital state of "soft Eclipse" ("I'm 'wife' -- I've finished that") in relation to the manipulative Reinhardt. But, seeing Reinhardt take those repugnant pictures loosens an anger in Kristine and, day by day, she finds herself allowing smothered ambitions to resurface. In a masterly narrative stroke guaranteed to make longtime followers of the Inspector Sejer series gasp out loud, Fossum intertwines her two divergent story lines in the very final paragraph of this slim-but-dense marvel of a mystery. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Then blowing again.<br><br><i>Jesus,</i> Carla thought. <i>What a bunch of losers.<br><br></i>Watching them made her feel, in every restless inch of her seventeen-year-old body, so infinitely superior to these withered fools and their pathetic little rituals that she was pretty sure it showed; she was fairly certain her contempt was half visible, rising from her skin in a skittish little shimmer.

It&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;d ever say anything rude out loud.<br><br>She was bored, though, and speculating about the old farts was recreational.<br><br>To get a better look, without being totally obvious about it, she let her head loll casually to one side, like a flower suddenly too heavy for its stalk, and narrowed and shifted her eyes, while keeping her chin centered in her palm.<br><br>Now the old men were laughing again. They opened their mouths too wide, and she could see that some of their teeth were stained a weird greenish yellow-brown that looked like the color of the lettuce she&#x2019;d sometimes find way in the back of the fridge, the kind her mom bought and then forgot about. It was, Carla thought with a shudder of oddly pleasurable repugnance, the Official Color of Old Man Teeth.<br>She didn&#x2019;t know any of them. Or maybe she did. All old men looked alike, right? And old towns like the one she lived in&#x2014;Acker&#x2019;s Gap, West Virginia, or as Carla and her friends preferred to call it, <i>The Middle of Freakin&#x2019; Nowhere</i>&#x2014;were filled with old men.

It was just another crappy fact she had to deal with in her crappy life, on her way to what was surely an even crappier future.<br><br>Her thoughts had been leaning that way all morning long, leaning toward disgust and despair, and the constant proximity of gross old men in the Salty Dawg was one of the reasons why.<br><br>Another was that her mother was late to pick her up.<br><br>Again.<br><br>So Carla was pissed.<br><br>They had agreed on 11 A.M. It was now 11:47. And no sign of good old Mom, who also wasn&#x2019;t answering her cell. Carla Elkins was forced to sit here, getting free refills on her Diet Coke and playing with her french fries, pulling them out of the red cardboard ark one by one and stacking them up like tiny salty Lincoln Logs. Building a wall. A fort, maybe. A greasy little fort. She&#x2019;d just had her nails done the day before over at Le Salon, and the black polish&#x2014;she was picking up another french fry now, and another, and another, and another, while her other hand continued to prop up her chin&#x2014;looked even blacker by contrast with the washed-out beige of each skinny french fry.<br><br>Her mother hated black nail polish, which was why Carla chose it. She wasn&#x2019;t crazy about it herself, but if it pissed off her mom, she&#x2019;d make the sacrifice.<br><br>The Salty Dawg was right down the street from the Acker&#x2019;s Gap Community Resource Center&#x2014;the RC, everybody called it&#x2014;which was a long, square, flat-roofed dump of a place with ginormous plate-glass windows cut into three sides of the icky yellow brick. Somebody&#x2019;d once told Carla that, a million years ago, the RC had been a Ford dealership.<br><br>That was Acker&#x2019;s Gap for you: Everything had once been something else. There was nothing new. Nothing fresh or different. Ever.<br><br>She had to endure her court-mandated Teen Anger Management Workshop at the RC on Saturday mornings, 8:00 to 10:30, during which time the counselor would go around the circle and ask each of them what she or he was feeling. <i>What I&#x2019;m feeling,</i> Carla wanted to say, <i>is that this is a lame-ass way to spend a Saturday morning</i>. But she didn&#x2019;t. Usually, when her turn came, she just scooted a little bit forward and a little bit back on the chair&#x2019;s tiny wheels and stared at her black fingernails and mumbled, <i>I&#x2019;m, um, feeling kind of mixed up inside.</i> Her friend Lonnie Prince had told her once that adults want to hear that kind of thing, so that they can nod and look all concerned and show that they remember how hard it is to be a teenager, even though it was, like, a thousand years ago.<br><br>The counselor always dismissed them right at 10:30. On the dot. He didn&#x2019;t want to spend one more minute with them than they wanted to spend with him. Half an hour after that, her mother was supposed to pick her up at the Salty Dawg. Her mother&#x2019;s office was just up the street, in the county courthouse, and she was working this Saturday, so it was a good plan.<br><br>Except that her mother was late. Again.<br><br>A shriek sliced through the room. It startled Carla, making her fingers twitch, which in turn caused her to demolish one entire wall of Fort French Fry.<br><br>Her head whipped around. A little girl and a man&#x2014;surely the kid&#x2019;s father, Carla thought, because they looked alike, they both had broad, squashed-looking noses and stick-straight, dirty-blond hair&#x2014;were sitting across from each other in a booth in the corner. The little girl was screaming and pounding the tabletop with a pair of fat pink fists, flinging her head back and forth. The dad, meanwhile, his white shirtsleeves rolled up to reveal a pair of aggressively hairy forearms, was leaning across the table, clutching a chicken biscuit with most of its yellow wrapper removed. His face was frozen in a hopeful, slightly crazed-looking smile. The girl, though&#x2014;she was four, maybe five&#x2014;was ignoring him and instead just kept screaming and jerking her head around. Threads of dirty-blond hair were stuck in the snot ejected by her nose in two bright tubes of ooze.<br><br>The father was panicky, confused, desperate. <i>Gotta be a divorced dad,</i> Carla surmised. <i>Gotta be some asshole out to bank some kid time on the weekend.</i> He was clearly a rookie. An amateur. He made cooing sounds, trying to do something, anything, that would stop the ferocious yowling.<br><br><i>Give it up, dude,</i> Carla thought.<br><br>She knew all about part-time dads who wanted to make up for everything in a few short hours on a Saturday morning at the Salty Dawg. She could&#x2019;ve written a handbook. Offered tips. She could&#x2019;ve told this jerk that he&#x2019;d blown it by starting to unwrap the chicken biscuit for his daughter. <i>Never, never, never.</i> The more wounded the little girl was, the more blindsided by the divorce, the more she&#x2019;d want to do everything by herself from now on. It was survival instinct. She was in training. Getting ready for the day when Daddy Dearest didn&#x2019;t come around so much anymore.<br><br>Carla&#x2019;s attention swiveled back to the three old men. They were still laughing, still making those horrible old-man-laughing sounds that came out like a whiny scritchy-scratch. One of them was using the back of his brown-spotted hand to dab at a happy tear that was leaking out of his disgusting-looking runny eye. After the dab he reared back his head and peered at that hand, like he wondered how he&#x2019;d gotten the wet spot on it.<br><br>She saw the three old men in their matching black jackets, laughing, mouths open, faces pleated.<br><br>She saw them savoring their little joke.<br><br>Then she saw them die.<br><br><i>Pock<br><br></i><i>Pock<br><br></i><i>Pock<br><br></i>One shot per head.<br><br>By the time a startled Carla let go of the french fry she was holding&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been rebuilding Fort French Fry from scratch&#x2014;the three old men were gone.<br><br>One slumped onto the little beige tabletop, knocking over his coffee. Blood an...</p><h2>Travels with a Tangerine: From Morocco to Turkey in the Footsteps of Islam&#39;s Greatest Traveler</h2><p>In 1325, the great Arab traveler Ibn Battutah set out from his native Tangier in North Africa on pilgrimage to Mecca. By the time he returned nearly thirty years later, he had seen most of the known world, covering three times the distance allegedly traveled by the great Venetian explorer Marco Polo&#x2014;some 75,000 miles in all. <br><br>Captivated by Ibn Battutah&#x2019;s account of his journey, the Arabic scholar and award-winning travel writer Tim Mackintosh-Smith set out to follow in the peripatetic Moroccan&#x2019;s footsteps. Traversing Egyptian deserts and remote islands in the Arabian Sea, visiting castles in Syria and innumerable souks in medieval Islam&#x2019;s great cities, Mackintosh-Smith sought clues to Ibn Battutah&#x2019;s life and times, encountering the ghost of &#x201c;IB&#x201d; in everything from place names (in Tangier alone, a hotel, street, airport, and ferry bear IB&#x2019;s name), to dietary staples to an Arabic online dating service&#x2014; and introducing us to a world of unimaginable wonders. <br> <br>By necessity, Mackintosh-Smith&#x2019;s journey may have cut some corners (&#x201c;I only wish I had the odd thirty years to spare, and Ibn Battutah&#x2019;s enviable knack of extracting large amounts of cash, robes and slaves from compliant rulers.&#x201d;) But in this wry, evocative, and uniquely engaging travelogue, he spares no effort in giving readers an unforgettable glimpse into both the present-day and fourteenth-century Islamic worlds.</p><p><b>Tim Mackintosh-Smith</b>&nbsp;studied classical Arabic at Oxford. At the age of twenty-one, like Ibn Battutah, he headed east for the real Arabia.&nbsp;His first book, <i>Yemen: The Unknown Arabia</i>, won the Thomas Cook/<i>Daily Telegraph</i> Travel Book Award and was a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book.<br><br><b>Martin Yeoman </b>is a painter, draughtsman, sculptor, and etcher whose work can be found in a number of notable British collections, including those of HM the Queen and HRH the Prince Wales.The author (Yemen: The Unknown Arabia), a British Arabist who has lived in Yemen for the past 17 years, traces the footsteps of an extraordinary, but relatively unknown, medieval explorer. Ibn Battutah (1304-1368) grew up in Tangier within an educated family. At the age of 21, he embarked on a pilgrimage to Mecca and spent the next 30 years traveling throughout the Middle and Far East. When Mackintosh-Smith happened on a translated version of Battutah's travels, he was hooked and decided to make the same journey. This volume covers only the first part of Battutah's path, from Tangier to Constantinople, but has enough excitement, exotic details and information to satisfy the most exacting armchair traveler. The author brings his research skills, scholarship and respect for all cultures to bear on Battutah's adventures and his own. Written with humor and style, he describes how Battutah "schmoozed with sultans" in Denizli, Turkey. In Damascus, the author enjoys a brain burger for breakfast before visiting the Umayyad Mosque, a structure Battutah detailed in 10 pages and referred to as "the greatest Mosque on earth." Throughout this narrative, Mackintosh-Smith provides enough anecdotes about Battutah's knowledge of aphrodisiacs, the foods he ate, the hardships he endured, the people he met and, most tellingly, the wonders he beheld to bring this unique daredevil and his times to life.

He's using unscrupulous methods and legal ambiguities to force homeowners to sell their valuable land at rock bottom prices. He's even approached fisherman/sometime-sleuth J. W. Jackson and his wife Zee, not realizing that the retired Boston cop is anything but an easy mark. So when Donald's brother Paul is shot by an unseen assailant on a Vineyard street, J. W. can't help wondering if the wrong Fox sibling inadvertently took the bullet. Since Jackson's curiosity and deep-rooted sense of justice have always gotten the better of him -- and since the bluefish aren't running yet anyway -- he's going to track down the shooter, before preseason on his beloved isle turns irrevocably deadly.</p></p><p><p>Philip R. Craig grew up on a small cattle ranch near Durango, Colorado, before going off to college at Boston University, where he was an All-American fencer. He earned his M.F.A. at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. A recently retired professor of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he and his wife Shirley now live year-round on Martha's Vineyard.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Our children, Joshua and Diana, were over on the mainland for two days, being spoiled by Zee's mother and father, and Zee and I were having lunch in the E and E Deli with John and Mattie Skye. It was a sunny but chilly March day, with a cold wind blowing from the north. </p><p> Outside, the traffic at the dread five corners in Vineyard Haven was moving smoothly along. Such would not be the case when summer arrived and the street would be a slow-moving parking lot. </p><p> "Too bad the twins couldn't make it down with you," said Zee, wiping her lips. </p><p> "The girls have more interesting ways to spend their long weekend than being with their parents," said Mattie. "They're college women now." </p><p> I could remember when John and Mattie's daughters, Jen and Jill, were little girls, about the ages our children were now. I hadn't been able to tell them apart then, and I still couldn't. "They don't make a quesadilla as good as this one up in Weststock," I said. </p><p> "But Weststock has college men," explained Mattie. "Compared to that, even E and E food has insufficient appeal." </p><p> "You're brave to leave them alone up there for three days," said Zee. </p><p> I suspected that she was thinking of our Diana, who would be of interest to young men in another ten years or so. I shared her view, having begun worrying about just such boys shortly after Diana had been born. </p><p> "They're eighteen," said John, who made his living teaching medieval lit at Weststock College. "They're supposed to be grown-up enough to stay out of trouble." </p><p> I had never grown up that much, so said nothing about John's fantasy. </p><p> The front door opened and let in both some cold air and John Reilley, who looked carefully around the room, nodded slightly to me, and went to the counter to order. </p><p> I knew a folk song about a sailor named John Riley, but I didn't know much about this John Reilley. Two things I did know were that he always took a survey of a room before he entered it, and that he was a carpenter with the reputation of being good with his hands. It was an excellent reputation to have on an island that was awash with money being spent by people buying old houses, tearing them down, and then building massive new ones. John Reilley would never be out of work as long as he lived on Martha's Vineyard. </p><p> Almost immediately the door opened again and three other men came in, one limping slightly and carrying a silver-headed cane. After sweeping the room with their eyes, they followed John Reilley to the counter. Apparently today was a day when everybody was checking out delis before they came in. Strange. </p><p> "Well, well," said John Skye in a quiet voice. "I see that even evil real estate developers are allowed in this joint." </p><p> My face apparently revealed my ignorance, because John added, "The one in the middle is Donald Fox, the boss of Saberfox. The one on his right is his little brother Paul. I don't know the guy with the cane." </p><p> "Ah," said Zee, straightening and frowning as she looked at Donald Fox. "The Savannah Swordsman himself, eh?" </p><p> I now glanced that way, too, for Fox's name was a headliner in the local press. The Fox brothers were tall, handsome men wearing expensive winter coats, but Donald's face was as hard as his brother's was gentle. </p><p> "The very same," said John. "Did I tell you that one of his minions has contacted us and made the now famous offer to purchase our place?" </p><p> "No, you didn't," said Zee, glancing at Mattie's angry face, "but Jeff and I have also been honored by a similar visit. The rep was a Mr. Albert Kirkland, complete with coat and tie and one of those little laptop computers that people carry around instead of briefcases these days. Jeff told him to take a hike." </p><p> "I was much nicer than that," I said. "I just told him we weren't interested in selling any land." </p><p> "And he said that it might be wise to reconsider since a lot of Vineyard land titles are pretty fuzzy and that Saberfox was doing extensive research in the Registry of Deeds." </p><p> "He left before any shots were fired," I said. </p><p> "What's scary," said Zee, "is that Saberfox has more money and lawyers than God and can outspend almost anybody who has land he wants. Donald Fox has already ripped off half the people on the island and he's suing the other half." </p><p> "That's a slight exaggeration," I said. "He's mostly ripped off poor people, because the rich ones have as many lawyers as he does." </p><p> "Well, he's after Dodie Donawa's place for sure! He's done what he always does: he's offered her about a quarter of what the place is worth, and told her if she doesn't go along, he'll take her to court! She'll have to take his offer because she hasn't got the money to fight him. Disgusting! If Dave Donawa was still alive he'd probably shoot him!" </p><p> "Maybe somebody else will do it, dear." </p><p> "It wouldn't surprise me!" </p><p> "Down, Fang! I think we should change the subject before you get so mad you hurt yourself." </p><p> Zee glared at me, then at Fox, then back at me. She was not in a conciliatory mood. I turned to John. "What's your next project, now that you're finally done with <i>Gawain?</i>" </p><p> John Skye had been working for years on an ultimate authoritative translation of <i>Gawain and the Green Knight</i> and had at last finished it, whereupon he had immediately entered into a serious state of postpartum blues. This was a typical experience, he said, of writers who had just finished books. And there was only one way out of it: start a new one. </p><p> "Well, that Southern swashbuckler over there gives me one idea," he said. "Maybe I'll write a history of swordplay, from sharp sticks to modern fencing. Who better than me? After all, I dazzled them on the fencing strip when I was an undergraduate, and now that I'm almost a rich and famous literary scholar I'm the right man for the job." </p><p> "He's kidding about the rich and famous part, of course," said Mattie. "So far all he's gotten from Gawain is some good prepub commentary from other medievalists. He doesn't even have a publisher." </p><p> "But I'll get one," said John, waving a professorial hand. "Readers all over the world will be lined up to buy copies. I'll be on endless book tours. It's inevitable." </p><p> "I'm impressed by the way you can keep a straight face when you say that," said Zee. "I don't believe I know any rich and famous scholars." </p><p> "I'll be the first," said John. "Anyway, maybe I'll do the fencing book. Skeptics will claim that it won't make any money either, because there are only about two fencers left in the United States and neither of them can afford to buy a book. They'll say that it's a typical pointy-headed-intellectual project: a book no one will read, about a topic totally irrelevant to modern times. But what do they know?" </p><p> Fencing, it was true, was not a major sport in America. However, it did have its practitioners, including several who worked out twice a week in the high school gym as members of the Martha's Vineyard Fencing Club. I'd watched them a time or two myself, attracted, no doubt, by having seen a number of swashbuckling movies on late-night TV. </p><p> I'd even been persuaded to pick up a foil, but had rapidly realized that I had no more skill as a fencer than as a dancer, and that the cause for both failures was the same: feet that didn't move properly when called upon to do so. They worked well enough for other things, but not for dancing or fencing. The reason was elusive but the fact was certain. </p><p> John, on the other hand, had on his library wall a battered mask centered on a triangled crossing of foil, �p�e, and saber that testified to his collegiate skill as a three-weapon man. Now, at sixty or so, he did his fencing with his forefinger, thrusting and parrying gracefully in thin air as he outlined his project. </p><p> "The first good part, of course, will be the research. I'll find out stuff I never knew. I'll go back into history as far as I can and trace sword fighting up to modern times, when training for combat turned into a sport." </p><p> "I presume you'll have a chapter on Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Junior," I said, "and another one on Zorro. They're the only fencers most people have ever heard of." </p><p> "A splendid idea. I'll have a chapter devoted to the movies, complete with lots of pictures. Flynn wasn't much of a fencer, by his own admission, but Cornell Wilde was a potential Olympian. </p><p> "Most people probably never heard of the real fencing champions -- Nadi and Fonst and d'Oriola and the others -- but they'll know about them when I win the Nobel Prize and fencing becomes the world's most popular sport. And they'll know about the guys who were around when I was slinging steel: Levis and Axelrod and Richards and Juan Diego Valentine." </p><p> "Are you going to mention our friend Donald Fox?" asked Mattie sourly. "Wasn't he America's only Olympic-gold-medalist fencer before he became a real estate tycoon?" </p><p> The tycoon under discussion, perhaps hearing his name, glanced her way with sharp, pitiless eyes. He stared at our table, then turned away. </p><p> Beyond him John Reilley looked at him thoughtfully, then turned and walked out into the chilly street, carrying his order in a paper bag. </p><p> "Sure," said John Skye, "I'll mention Fox. I'll have to, because like him or not he was the most successful competitive fencer America has ever produced." He paused. "Some people who know fencing think he was the best saber man the world has produced in the last fifty years. Personally, though, I'd put my money on Juan Diego Valentine." </p><p> "Was he a world champion?" asked Zee. </p><p> "No," said John. "But I saw him in Spain when I was over there one summer. He was training for the Spanish Olympic team. He was the best I ever saw. Better than me, even, if you can imagine that." </p><p> "Inconceivable," said Mattie, rolling her eyes. </p><p> "What happened to him?" asked Zee. </p><p> John shrugged. "Who knows? I expected him to win the Olympic gold medal the next year, but he wasn't even on the Spanish team. Maybe he got hurt, or maybe he decided to enter a monastery. Things happen." </p><p> Across the room, Donald Fox and his companions took their paper bags of food and headed out the door. </p><p> John gestured. "Apparently Mr. Fox is so busy making money that he has to eat on the run just like ordinary human beings." </p><p> The rest of us turned to watch the men hunch their shoulders against the wind and walk across the street. They were about halfway across when I heard two little firecracker sounds off to the right and the man John had identified as Paul Fox staggered and fell. The man with the cane instantly muscled Donald Fox at a fast trot across the street to the shelter of a building on the corner. </p><p> I rose without thinking and headed for the door. "Call nine-one-one," I said to the boy behind the counter. "Tell them that a man's been shot." </p><p> "Wait!" cried Zee. </p><p> But I didn't wait. When I got to the street I glanced in the direction of the firecracker sounds, saw nothing, and ran out to the fallen man. I got my arms under him and dragged him back to shelter in front of the deli. He was white-faced and moaning between gritted teeth. </p><p> "Help is coming," I said. "Do you know where you're hit?" </p><p> He put a hand on the center of his chest. "Right here. It hurts. God damn!" He was gasping for breath. </p><p> I tore open his coat and saw two slugs half buried in a bulletproof vest. </p><p> "You're wearing armor." </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "A fortunate choice of clothing. Lie still." </p><p> On the far side of the street the man with the cane had both arms around Donald Fox, holding him back. </p><p> "Stay right where you are till the cops get here," I called to them. "He's going to be okay." Then I looked at the deli door, where John Skye and Mattie were hanging on to Zee, and said, "You stay right there, too!" Mattie and John hung on harder. </p><p> I heard the first of the sirens. "You'll be fine," I said to Paul Fox, "but stay where you are until the medics get here." </p><p> His eyes were wide and full of fear. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright � 2003 by Philip R.

It is an excellent introduction to Christian ethics focusing on two well-known passages.</p><p>Yiu Sing L�c�s Chan (1968&#x2013;2015) taught at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, a graduate school of Santa Clara University.Chan, a Jesuit from Hong Kong, seeks to bring together biblical studies and Christian ethics through the vehicle of Christian virtue ethics, and illustrates his approach with reference to the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes. After an eleven-page prologue, Chan develops his schema for bridging biblical studies and Christian ethics. Then through the lens of virtue ethics, he examines each of the Ten Commandments according to Exod 20:2-17, and each of the Beatitudes in Mt 5:3-12. For each of the Commandments and the Beatitudes, he starts with the original meaning of the text and explores its significance for contemporary Christian moral living through a hermeneutics of virtue ethics. At the end of the book he discusses the possible reception of the core Christian virtues of the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes for Confucian society out of his conviction that interfaith or cross-cultural ethics begins with very specific texts and needs to be both text-based and interpretive. J. F. Keenan and D. J. Harrington have provided a three-page foreword. (<i>New Testament Abstracts</i>)<br><br>This is an important contribution to Catholic and Christian ethics that works to bridge the key sources of Scripture and systematic ethical reflection. Too often scholars either explore the biblical perspectives on ethics alone or take a more philosophical approach to ethics, but not the two together. Chan, who is on the faculty of Trinity College in Dublin, focuses on two key biblical texts that have had enormous influence on Christian ethics&#x2014;the Decalogue and the Beatitudes. He probes these biblical sources through the lens of "virtue" ethics, an approach to ethical reflection that has to come to the forefront in recent years. This approach does not focus just on identifying moral principles but also considers the issues of character formation, Christian practices, and habits of virtue. Chan wants not only to bring sound biblical exegesis to these key biblical texts but to consider their practical meaning for an ethical Christian life. (<i>The Bible Today</i>)<br><br>In The Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes: Biblical Studies and Ethics for Real Life, Yiu Sing L�c�s Chan, a Jesuit from Hong Kong who trained at Boston College, seeks to build bridges between the two disciplines with the help of Christian virtue ethics. The key questions of virtue ethics are, Who am I? What is my goal? and How do I achieve that goal? Done in the Christian key, we are children of God in search of eternal happiness with God through Christ. The cultivation of the appropriate virtues, attitudes and dispositions is the major task of Christian virtue ethics. (<i>America: The Jesuit Review of Faith &amp; Culture</i>)<br><br>The work is thoroughly an outcome of a scholarly work. The effort that the author has rendered to bring out such an excellent work is praiseworthy. . . . The work is a landmark to bridge the gap between biblical studies and moral theology. The work will be really an asset to the scriptural based ethics. (<i>Bible Bhashyam: An Indian Biblical Quarterly</i>)<br><br>In this fine study Yiu Sing L�c�s Chan focuses on the Decalogue and the Beatitudes as formative of virtuous community and character. It makes a significant contribution to the important conversation about the relation of Scripture and Christian Ethics not only because these Biblical passages surely count among the most important and influential biblical passages for Christian Ethics but also because of its innovative use of the virtue tradition as the mode of exposition. Moreover, the epilogue comparing his exposition to the Confucian tradition is a brief but important contribution to comparative ethics. It's a good book, and I welcome it. (Allen Verhey, Duke Divinity School)<br><br>Lucas Chan skillfully brings together biblical exegesis and ethical theory in this excellent book. He is a bridge builder across cultures, east and west, and confessional differences, Catholic and Protestant. Yet the truly masterful achievement of Chan&#x2019;s work is the ability to cross over and back between biblical scholars and moral theologians to develop a biblical ethic that is insightful and wise. (Kenneth R. Himes, OFM, Boston College)<br><br>L�c�s Chan combines responsible exegesis with sophisticated ethical theory in a way that is all too rare in studies of biblical ethics. Rooted in Catholic tradition, he draws on Calvin as well as Aquinas and even interacts with Confucianism. This is a stimulating and important contribution to the study of biblical values. (John J. Collins, Holmes Professor of Old Testament, Yale University)<br><br>This book constitutes a major step forward in the blending of biblical studies and ethics. Moreover, it brings together scholarly research, wisdom, and practical insights for our daily lives. It offers treasures for any reader seeking paths for moral and spiritual growth. (Margaret A. Farley, Gilbert L. Stark Professor of Christian Ethics, Yale University Divinity School)</p><h2>Highlander Unchained: A Novel (Macleods of Skye)</h2><p>Lachlan Maclean will do whatever it takes to protect his clan&#x2013;even if it means abducting the most willful woman in the Highlands with the secret intention of wooing her for marriage.

I haven&#x2019;t seen you so subdued in months.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too late to turn back, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>But it was. She&#x2019;d made her decision the moment she&#x2019;d snuck out of Holyrood House and scrambled into the waiting carriage.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to turn back.&#x201d; But the vehemence she&#x2019;d intended was lost when her voice vibrated with the clattering carriage. A carriage that was fighting to stay upright on the uneven road. She grabbed the seat as best she could when they hit another bump and tried not to crash sidelong into the glossy, wood-paneled walls. A battle she was sure to lose before this day was done. The road leading from Edinburgh would only get worse as they neared the parish of Falkirk.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe we would have been better off riding after all?&#x201d; she ventured. It was at Lord Murray&#x2019;s insistence that they&#x2019;d taken the carriage&#x2014;luxurious, but impractical on the road to the Highland divide.<br><br>&#x201c;No need to worry on that account. We&#x2019;re perfectly safe. My coachman is an excellent driver.&#x201d; William tried to hand her back her purse, which had slid off the bench beside her, but it slipped through her fingers, landing on the floor again. He laughed. &#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d see the day that Flora MacLeod was nervous.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mouth twitched, caught. &#x201c;Perhaps I am a bit anxious. I&#x2019;ve never done this before, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave her hand a friendly pat. &#x201c;I should hope not. But no need to worry, everything is all arranged. It shouldn&#x2019;t be much longer now.&#x201d;<br><br>She sat back against the seat and tried to relax. If all went according to plan, in a few hours she would be Lady Murray. Lord Murray&#x2014;William, she reminded herself&#x2014;had found a minister willing to preside over the clandestine marriage ceremony without proclaiming the banns. Every man had his price, and for the minister of the St. Mary&#x2019;s Kirk it happened to be a cask of fine claret and five hundred merks. More than enough to soften the blow of any fine that might be levied against him for performing the irregular marriage ceremony.<br><br>An irregular marriage was Flora&#x2019;s only option. She would not take a chance that one of her brothers, or her powerful cousin, would hear of her plans beforehand and try to stop her.<br><br>If she had to marry, she thought grimly, it would be a man of her choosing.<br><br>She cursed the fates for putting her in this position. She had no desire to marry at all. But it was her great misfortune to be half-sister to not one, but two powerful Highland chiefs. And if that weren&#x2019;t enough, her cousin was the most influential Highlander in Scotland. But this &#x201c;marriage prize,&#x201d; as she was infuriatingly referred to, would rather avoid the state altogether. Marriage brought nothing but unhappiness.<br><br>Her mother&#x2019;s misery was all too fresh in Flora&#x2019;s mind.<br><br>But about the only thing worse than being married was being forced to marry. So rather than risk the alternative, she&#x2019;d decided to take the matter of her husband in her own hands. In this case by riding at breakneck speed through the countryside to find a minister of questionable repute in an out-of-the-way parish where she would not be recognized.<br><br>She gazed sidelong at the man seated opposite her. Even in the darkness of the carriage she could see the silvery sheen of blond hair cascading across a face that could only be described as sublime. But though he was undeniably pleasing to the eye, it was not his looks that had made her decide to accept his proposal. Nor was it his wit and intelligence, of which he also had a superfluity. It was because William had wealth, power, and position of his own&#x2014;he did not need hers. She had no need to question his motives beyond what he&#x2019;d stated: Their union was of friends who would seek their mutual advantage by their union.<br><br>As an added boon, he didn&#x2019;t seem particularly concerned with Highland politics. And of that subject, she&#x2019;d heard her fill. The lessons of the mother had indeed been well learned by the daughter. She would sooner marry a toad than a Highlander.<br><br>And Lord Murray was infinitely more appealing than a toad.<br><br>&#x201c;And what of you, William. Any second thoughts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;None whatsoever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry what will happen when they discover&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that what this is about?&#x201d; He took her hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze. &#x201c;You wrote the letters, did you not?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. One good thing about having so many relatives was that there were many places she could claim to be with none the wiser. Fortunately, the one person who might question her whereabouts&#x2014;her cousin Elizabeth Campbell&#x2014;was on Skye attending to the birth of Flora&#x2019;s latest nephew. The second son in as many years of her half-brother Alex and his wife, Meg&#x2014;a wife Flora had never met. Her mother had been too ill to travel the year they&#x2019;d come to court.<br><br>&#x201c;Then there is no reason to assume they will find out,&#x201d; William said confidently. &#x201c;And thanks to your disguise, no one will have noticed you leaving the palace.&#x201d;<br><br>Noting the direction of his gaze, she touched the white linen cap she wore on her head. She grinned, amused by the image she must present. Flora was well-known for her propensity to find mischief at Holyrood House. But sneaking out of the palace at midnight to elope with one of the most powerful young men at court, dressed as a maidservant, was sure to top all that had come before. She&#x2019;d outdone herself. And coming from the girl who&#x2019;d once donned breeches and climbed halfway down the parapet beneath her balcony at Castle Campbell before her cousin Jamie caught her, that was saying something.<br><br>Uncomfortably aware of the scratchy woolen dress she was wearing that poked right through the fine linen of her shift, she asked, &#x201c;You were able to pick up my gown?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As charmingly rustic as you look, my dear, I hardly think the future Countess of Tullibardine should be married dressed as a servant. Your gown is in the trunk, though procuring it from your dressmaker did take some explaining.&#x201d;<br><br>Flora chuckled, thinking of the dour Frenchwoman. The court&#x2019;s preference for French fashion was the one lasting legacy from the reign of Mary Queen of Scots&#x2014;other than her son, King James, of course. &#x201c;It seemed the easiest thing to do. I could hardly sneak it out with me. Madame de Ville already thinks me horribly indecorous. I doubt anything you could say would change her opinion.&#x201d; Indecorous was probably an understatement. Flora had a reputation at court for being more than a touch unruly.<br><br>Fortunately, William had never seemed to be bothered by her reputation. If anything, her penchant for finding trouble seemed to amuse him. After news of tonight&#x2019;s events spread, he was going to need that sense of humor. Their elopement was sure to cause a scandal far greater than anything she&#x2019;d ever managed before.<br><br>She bit her lip. He was taking a risk. Not much older than her four and twenty years, he&#x2019;d already made a name for himself in King James&#x2019;s northern court. He wielded considerable influence among the privy councillors&#x2014;the men left in charge while the king wooed his recalcitrant English subjects at Whitehall. Eloping with the Earl of Argyll&#x2019;s cousin, and the half-sister of Rory MacLeod and Hector Maclean, was a potentially dangerous move for a young man of ambition.<br><br>One that might be excused by strength of affection, but Flora did not delude herself in that regard. Although attentive, her soon-to-be husband could hardly be described as besotted. As her feelings were similarly disengaged, it was actually another element in his favor. There would be no pretense on either side. They were friends, nothing more. It was far more than could be said of most marriages.<br><br>Most important, she knew him well enough to know that he would not try to control her. She would live her life, and he would live his. It was all she wanted.<br><br>But what of him? What did he want?<br><br>Flora had known William for years, ever since she&#x2019;d first made her appearance at court six years ago. But unlike most of the young men of her acquaintance, he&#x2019;d never pursued her. His sudden courtship&#x2014;in earnest&#x2014;upon her recent return to Edinburgh was thus unexpected but admittedly well timed.<br><br>For scarcely a few days after he&#x2019;d made his intentions known, a letter from her half-brother Rory, Chief of MacLeod, arrived requesting her presence at Dunvegan Castle to &#x201c;discuss her future.&#x201d; Ironically, the request from Rory was followed not long after by one from her half-brother Hector, Chief of Maclean, requesting her presence on the Isle of Mull. Flora was hardly fooled by the near simultaneous requests. A discussion about her future could mean only one thing for a young woman of four and twenty left alone by the sudden death of her mother: marriage. Or, more specifically, the right to control her marriage.<br><br>With her mother gone and her father buried long before, the right belonged to Rory. A brother she hardly knew. From what she did remember of him, he didn&#x2019;t seem as if he would force her to marry a man not of her choosing. But she could not take the chance. Even if Rory could be persuaded, Hector and her cousin Argyll wouldn&#x2019;t let the matter be decided without interference.<br><br>All three would be furious to discover what she&#x2019;d done.<br><br>Her brothers should have known better than to try to force her hand. Though she hadn&#x2019;t seen them in some time, in some ways she hadn&#x2019;t changed. But perhaps they&#x2019;d forgotten the little girl who hated to be backed into a corner?<br><br>Flora gazed at William again, peering through the darkness to study him a little longer, wondering not for the first time why he&#x2019;d agreed to her plan to elope. But she quickly pushed aside the sudden twinge of uncertainty.</p><h2>The Last: A Novel</h2><p><b>This propulsive post-apocalyptic thriller &#x201c;in which Agatha Christie&#x2019;s <i>And Then There Were None</i> collides with Stephen King&#x2019;s <i>The Shining</i>&#x201d; (NPR) follows a group of survivors stranded at a hotel as the world descends into nuclear war and the body of a young girl is discovered in one of the hotel&#x2019;s water tanks. </b><br><br>Jon thought he had all the time in the world to respond to his wife&#x2019;s text message: <i>I miss you so much.

Sturgeon began publishing science fiction in 1939, and made his mark early in both fantasy and science fiction with stories that have since become classics. &#x201c;Microcosmic God&#x201d; concerns a scientist who plays God with unexpectedly amusing results when he repeatedly challenges a microscopic race he has created with threats to their survival. &#x201c;It&#x201d; focuses on the reactions of characters in a rural setting trying to contend with a rampaging inhuman monster. &#x201c;Killdozer&#x201d; is a variation on the theme of Frankenstein in which a construction crew is trapped on an island where a bulldozer has become imbued with the electrical energy of an alien life form.<br><br>Fiction Sturgeon wrote after World War II showed the gentle humor of his earlier work shading into pathos. &#x201c;Memorial&#x201d; and &#x201c;Thunder and Roses&#x201d; were cautionary tales about the abuses of use of nuclear weapons. &#x201c;A Saucer of Loneliness&#x201d; and &#x201c;Maturity&#x201d; both used traditional science- fiction scenarios to explore feelings of alienation and inadequacy. Sturgeon&#x2019;s work at novel length is memorable for its portrayals of characters who rise above the isolation their failure to fit into normal society imposes. More Than Human tells of a group of psychologically dysfunctional individuals who pool their individual strengths to create a superhuman gestalt consciousness. In The Dreaming Jewels, a young boy discovers that his behavioral abnormalities are actually the symptoms of super- human powers. Sturgeon is also renowned for his explorations of taboo sexuality and restrictive moralities in such stories as Some of Your Blood, &#x201c;The World Well Lost,&#x201d; and &#x201c;If All Men Were Brothers Would You Let One Marry Your Sister?&#x201d; His short fiction has been collected in Without Sorcery, E Pluribus Unicorn, Caviar, and A Touch of Strange. The compilations The Ultimate Egoist, Thunder and Roses, A Saucer of Lone- liness, The Perfect Host, Baby Is Three, The Microcosmic God, and Killdozer, edited by Paul Williams, are the first seven volumes in a series that will eventually reprint all of Sturgeon&#x2019;s short fiction.<br><br>Traveling into the past only to discover that the past isn&#x2019;t there any more is a popular conceit of the genre. &#x201c;Yesterday Was Monday,&#x201d; one of his most-often reprinted tales, is one of the early time-travel stories that were published after the pulp era, where the emphasis wasn&#x2019;t on science yet so much as strangeness, evoking a surreal feeling that this story embodies perfectly. Making the protagonist of the story an everyday person waking up in his own past instead of a scientist or an inventor only adds to the unusual blend of time travel and fantasy.<br><br>Yesterday Was Monday<br><br>Theodore Sturgeon<br><br> HARRY WRIGHT ROLLED over and said something spelled &#x201c;Bzzzzhha-a-aw!&#x201d; He chewed a bit on a mouthful of dry air and spat it out, opened one eye to see if it really would open, opened the other and closed the first, closed the second, swung his feet onto the floor, opened them again and stretched. This was a daily occurrence, and the only thing that made it remarkable at all was that he did it on a Wednesday morning, and&#x2014;<br><br>Yesterday was Monday.<br><br>Oh, he knew it was Wednesday all right. It was partly that, even though he knew yesterday was Monday, there was a gap between Monday and now; and that must have been Tuesday. When you fall asleep and lie there all night without dreaming, you know, when you wake up, that time has passed. You&#x2019;ve done nothing that you can remember; you&#x2019;ve had no particular thoughts, no way to gauge time, and yet you know that some hours have passed. So it was with Harry Wright. Tuesday had gone wherever your eight hours went last night.<br><br>But he hadn&#x2019;t slept through Tuesday. Oh no. He never slept, as a matter of fact, more than six hours at a stretch, and there was no particular reason for him doing so now. Monday was the day before yesterday; he had turned in and slept his usual stretch, he had awakened, and it was Wednesday.<br><br>It felt like Wednesday. There was a Wednesdayish feel to the air.<br><br>Harry put on his socks and stood up. He wasn&#x2019;t fooled. He knew what day it was. &#x201c;What happened to yesterday?&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Oh&#x2014;yesterday was Monday.&#x201d; That sufficed until he got his pajamas off. &#x201c;Monday,&#x201d; he mused, reaching for his underwear, &#x201c;was quite a while back, seems as though.&#x201d; If he had been the worrying type, he would have started then and there. But he wasn&#x2019;t. He was an easygoing sort, the kind of man that gets himself into a rut and stays there until he is pushed out. That was why he was an automobile mechanic at twenty-three dollars a week; that&#x2019;s why he had been one for eight years now, and would be from now on, if he could only find Tuesday and get back to work.<br><br>Guided by his reflexes, as usual, and with no mental effort at all, which was also usual, he finished washing, dressing, and making his bed. His alarm clock, which never alarmed because he was of such regular habits, said, as usual, six twenty-two when he paused on the way out, and gave his room the once-over. And there was a certain something about the place that made even this phlegmatic character stop and think.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t finished.<br><br>The bed was there, and the picture of Joe Louis. There were the two chairs sharing their usual seven legs, the split table, the pipe-organ bedstead, the beige wallpaper with the two swans over and over and over, the tiny corner sink, the tilted bureau. But none of them were finished. Not that there were any holes in anything. What paint there had been in the first place was still there. But there was an odor of old cut lumber, a subtle, insistent air of building, about the room and everything in it. It was indefinable, inescapable, and Harry Wright stood there caught up in it, wondering. He glanced suspiciously around but saw nothing he could really be suspicious of. He shook his head, locked the door and went out into the hall.<br><br>On the steps a little fellow, just over three feet tall, was gently stroking the third step from the top with a razor-sharp chisel, shaping up a new scar in the dirty wood. He looked up as Harry approached, and stood up quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; said Harry, taking in the man&#x2019;s leather coat, his peaked cap, his wizened, bright-eyed little face. &#x201c;Whatcha doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Touch-up,&#x201d; piped the little man. &#x201c;The actor in the third floor front has a nail in his right heel. He came in late Tuesday night and cut the wood here. I have to get it ready for Wednesday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is Wednesday,&#x201d; Harry pointed out.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Always has been. Always will be.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry let that pass, started on down the stairs. He had achieved his amazing bovinity by making a practice of ignoring things he could not understand. But one thing bothered him&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you say that feller in the third floor front was an actor?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. They&#x2019;re all actors, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re nuts, friend,&#x201d; said Harry bluntly. &#x201c;That guy works on the docks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes&#x2014;that&#x2019;s his part. That&#x2019;s what he acts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No kiddin&#x2019;. An&#x2019; what does he do when he isn&#x2019;t acting?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But he&#x2014;Well, that&#x2019;s all he does do! That&#x2019;s all any of the actors do!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gee&#x2014; I thought he looked like a reg&#x2019;lar guy, too,&#x201d; said Harry. &#x201c;An actor? &#x2019;Magine!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; said the little man, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ve got to get back to work. We mustn&#x2019;t let anything get by us, you know. They&#x2019;ll be through Tuesday before long, and everything must be ready for them.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry thought: this guy&#x2019;s crazy nuts. He smiled uncertainly and went down to the landing below. When he looked back the man was cutting skillfully into the stair, making a neat little nail scratch. Harry shook his head. This was a screwy morning. He&#x2019;d be glad to get back to the shop. There was a &#x2019;39 sedan down there with a busted rear spring. Once he got his mind on that he could forget this nonsense. That&#x2019;s all that matters to a man in a rut. Work, eat, sleep, pay day. Why even try to think anything else out?<br><br>The street was a riot of activity, but then it always was. But not quite this way. There were automobiles and trucks and buses around, aplenty, but none of them were moving. And none of them were quite complete. This was Harry&#x2019;s own field; if there was anything he didn&#x2019;t know about motor vehicles, it wasn&#x2019;t very important. And through that medium he began to get the general idea of what was going on.<br><br>Swarms of little men who might have been twins of the one he had spoken to were crowding around the cars, the sidewalks, the stores and buildings. All were working like mad with every tool imaginable. Some were touching up the finish of the cars with fine wire brushes, laying on networks of microscopic cracks and scratches. Some, with ball peens and mallets, were denting fenders skillfully, bending bumpers in an artful crash pattern, spider-webbing safety-glass windshields. Others were aging top dressing with high-pressure, needlepoint sandblasters. Still others were pumping dust into upholstery, sandpapering the dashboard finish around light switches, throttles, chokes, to give a finger-worn appearance. Harry stood aside as a half dozen of the workers scampered down the street bearing a fender which they riveted to a 1930 coup�. It was freshly bloodstained.<br><br>Once awakened to this highly unusual activity, Harry stopped, slightly open-mouthed, to watch what else was going on. He saw the same process being industriously accomplished with the houses and stores. Dirt was being laid on plate-glass windows over a coat of clear sizing. Woodwork was being cleverly scored and the paint peeled to make it look correctly weather-beaten, and dozens of leather-clad laborers were on their hands and knees, poking dust and dirt into the cracks between the paving blocks. A line of them went down the sidewalk, busily chewing gum and spitting it out; they were followed by another crew who carefully placed the wads according to diagrams they carried, and stamped them flat.<br><br>Harry set his teeth and muscled his rocking brain into something like its normal position. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t never seen a day like this or crazy people like this,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I ain&#x2019;t gonna let it be any of my affair. I got my job to go to.&#x201d; And trying vainly to ignore the hundreds of little, hard-working figures, he went grimly on down the street.<br><br>When he got to the garage he found no one there but more swarms of stereotyped little people climbing over the place, dulling the paint work, cracking the cement flooring, doing their hurried, efficient little tasks of aging. He noticed, only because he was so familiar with the garage, that they were actually making the marks that had been there as long as he had known the place. &#x201c;Hell with it,&#x201d; he gritted, anxious to submerge himself into his own world of wrenches and grease guns. &#x201c;I got my job; this is none o&#x2019; my affair.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked about him, wondering if he should clean these interlopers out of the garage. Naw&#x2014;not his affair, He was hired to repair cars, not to police the joint. Long as they kept away from him&#x2014;and, of course, animal caution told him that he was far, far outnumbered. The absence of the boss and the other mechanics was no surprise to Harry; he always opened the place.<br><br>He climbed out of his street clothes and into coveralls, picked up a tool case and walked over to the sedan, which he had left up on the hydraulic rack yester&#x2014; that is, Monday night. And that is when Harry Wright lost his temper. After all, the car was his job, and he didn&#x2019;t like having anyone else mess with a job he had started. So when he saw his job&#x2014;his &#x2019;39 sedan&#x2014;resting steadily on its wheels over the rack, which was down under the floor, and when he saw that the rear spring was repaired, he began to burn. He dived under the car and ran deft fingers over the rear wheel suspensions. In spite of his anger at this unprecedented occurrence, he had to admit to himself that the job had been done well. &#x201c;Might have done it myself,&#x201d; he muttered.<br><br>A soft clank and a gentle movement caught his attention. With a roar he reached out and grabbed the leg of one of the ubiquitous little men, wriggled out from under the car, caught his culprit by his leather collar, and dangled him at arm&#x2019;s length.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing to my job?&#x201d; Harry bellowed.<br><br>The little man tucked his chin into the front of his shirt to give his windpipe a chance, and said, &#x201c;Why, I was just finishing up that spring job.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. So you were just finishing up on that spring job,&#x201d; Harry whispered, choked with rage. Then, at the top of his voice, &#x201c;Who told you to touch that car?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who told me? What do you&#x2014; Well, it just had to be done, that&#x2019;s all. You&#x2019;ll have to let me go. I must tighten up those two bolts and lay some dust on the whole thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must what? You get within six feet o&#x2019; that car and I&#x2019;ll twist your head offn your neck with a Stillson!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014; It has to be done!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t do it! Why, I oughta&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please let me go! If I don&#x2019;t leave that car the way it was Tuesday night&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When was Tuesday night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The last act, of course. Let me go, or I&#x2019;ll call the district supervisor!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Call the devil himself. I&#x2019;m going to spread you on the sidewalk outside; and heaven help you if I catch you near here again!&#x201d;<br><br>The little man&#x2019;s jaw set, his eyes narrowed, and he whipped his feet upward. They crashed into Wright&#x2019;s jaw; Harry dropped him and staggered back. The little man began squealing, &#x201c;Supervisor! Supervisor! Emergency!&#x201d;<br><br>Harry growled and started after him; but suddenly, in the air between him and the midget workman, a long white hand appeared. The empty air was swept back, showing an aperture from the garage to blank, blind nothingness. Out of it stepped a tall man in a single loose-fitting garment literally studded with pockets. The opening closed behind the man.<br><br>Harry cowered before him. Never in his life had he seen such noble, powerful features, such strength of purpose, such broad shoulders, such a deep chest. The man stood with the backs of his hands on his hips, staring at Harry as if he were something somebody forgot to sweep up.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; said the little man shrilly. &#x201c;He is trying to stop me from doing the work!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; asked the beautiful man, down his nose.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the m-mechanic on this j-j&#x2014; Who wants to know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Iridel, supervisor of the district of Futura, wants to know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where in hell did you come from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did not come from hell. I came from Thursday.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry held his head. &#x201c;What is all this?&#x201d; he wailed. &#x201c;Why is today Wednesday? Who are all these crazy little guys? What happened to Tuesday?&#x201d;<br><br>Iridel made a slight motion with his finger, and the little man scurried back under the car. Harry was frenzied to hear the wrench busily tightening bolts. He half started to dive under after the little fellow, but Iridel said, &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; and when Iridel said, &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; Harry stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;This,&#x201d; said Iridel calmly, &#x201c;is an amazing occurrence.&#x201d; He regarded Harry with unemotional curiosity. &#x201c;An actor on stage before the sets are finished. Extraordinary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What stage?&#x201d; asked Harry. &#x201c;What are you doing here anyhow, and what&#x2019;s the idea of all these little guys working around here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You ask a great many questions, actor,&#x201d; said Iridel. &#x201c;I shall answer them, and then I shall have a few to ask you. These little men are stage hands&#x2014; I am surprised that you didn&#x2019;t realize that. They are setting the stage for Wednesday. Tuesday? That&#x2019;s going on now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Arrgh!&#x201d; Harry snorted. &#x201c;How can Tuesday be going on when today&#x2019;s Wednesday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Today isn&#x2019;t Wednesday, actor.&#x201d;...</p><h2>The Communist Horizon</h2><p>In this new title in Verso&#x2019;s Pocket Communism series, Jodi Dean unshackles the communist ideal from the failures of the Soviet Union.

Why did St. Augustine equate nothingness with the Devil? What tortuous means did 17th-century scientists employ in their attempts to create a vacuum? And why do contemporary quantum physicists believe that the void is actually seething with subatomic activity? You&#x2019;ll find the answers in this dizzyingly erudite and elegantly explained book by the English cosmologist John D. Barrow.<br><br>Ranging through mathematics, theology, philosophy, literature, particle physics, and cosmology, <b>The Book of Nothing </b>explores the enduring hold that vacuity has exercised on the human imagination. Combining high-wire speculation with a wealth of reference that takes in Freddy Mercury and Shakespeare alongside Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Stephen Hawking, the result is a fascinating excursion to the vanishing point of our knowledge.</p><p>From our modern perspective, it is easy to deride the wranglings of medieval scholars over the number of angels that could dance of the head of a pin and whether Nature abhors a vacuum. But as John Barrow reveals in this timely and important book, new discoveries in science have shown that these scholars were right to suspect that Nothing has hidden depths. <p> It is a concept shot through with paradoxes: even innocent-looking phrases like "Nothing is real" flip their meanings as we ponder them, like those illusions that look like a vase one moment, and opposing faces the next. Nothing is fertile, too, as Barrow shows via a stunning trick that allows every number one can think of to be built out of nothing at all. </p><p> But his book is about far more than mind games. Arguably, the most important discovery of 20th-century physics is that there is no such thing as nothing: even the tightest vacuum is teeming with subatomic particles popping in and out of existence, according to the dictates of quantum theory. Now, many astronomers suspect that such "vacuum effects" may have triggered the Big Bang itself, filling our universe with matter. Indeed, the very latest observations suggest that vacuum effects will dictate the ultimate fate of the universe. </p><p> As an internationally respected cosmologist, Barrow does a fine job of explaining these new discoveries. The result is a book that is required reading for anyone who wants to understand why there will be much ado about Nothing among scientists in the years ahead. <i>--Robert Matthews, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>&#x201c;Entertaining and informative...

Not surprisingly, therefore, Christine de Pizan's <em>The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry</em>, written around 1410, has often been regarded with disdain. Many have assumed that Christine was simply copying or pilfering earlier military manuals. But, as Sumner Willard and Charity Cannon Willard show in this faithful English translation, <em>The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry</em> contains much that is original to Christine. As a military manual it tells us a great deal about the strategy, tactics, and technology of medieval warfare and is one of our most important sources for early gunpowder weapon technology. It also includes a fascinating discussion of Just War.</p><p>Since the end of the fifteenth century, <em>The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry</em> has been available primarily through Antoine V�rard's imprint of 1488 or William Caxton's 1489 translation, <em>The Book of the Order of Chivalry</em>. V�rard even suggested that the work was his own translation of the Roman writer Vegetius, making no mention of Christine 's name. Caxton attributed the work to Christine, but it is impossible to identify the manuscript he used for his translation. Moreoever, both translations are inaccurate. The Willards correct these inaccuracies in a clear and easy-to-read translation, which they supplement with notes and an introduction that will greatly benefit students, scholars, and enthusiasts alike. Publication of this work should change our perception both of medieval warfare and of Christine de Pizan.</p></p><p><p>Sumner Willard, former professor at the U. S.

In Mary Wollstonecraft's Mary, the heroine flees her young husband in order to nurse her dearest friend, Ann, and finds genuine love, while Maria tells of a desperate young woman who seeks consolation in the arms of another man after the loss of her child. And Mary Shelley's Matilda - suppressed for over a century - tells the story of a woman alienated from society by the incestuous passion of her father. Humane, compassionate and highly controversial, these stories demonstrate the strongly original genius of their authors.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Wollstonecraft&#39;s first novel, Mary (1788), an exploration of an alienated intellectual woman and her struggle against the constraints of a claustrophobic feminine world, was followed by her Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). The posthumously published Maria moves from Wollstonecraft&#39;s own experiences to examine the miseries of women of all classes. Matilda (1819), Shelley&#39;s second novel, remained unpublished during her lifetime (1797-1851). Its theme of a father&#39;s incestuous desire for his daughter was considered provocative and scandalous. Her father, William Godwin, refused to publish it and it remained suppressed for over a century. Janet Todd&#39;s introduction links the novels of mother and daughter by their double exploration of self-representation, sexuality, and personal conflict.<b>Mary Wollstonecraft</b> (1759-97) was an educational, political and feminist writer who early in her life worked as a companion, teacher and governess. In 1788 she settled in London as a translator and reader for the publisher Joseph Johnson, becoming part of the radical set that included Paine, Blake, Godwin and the painter Fuseli. Her great work, <b>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</b>, was published in 1792. She lived in Paris during the French Revolution and had a child by the American Gilbert Imlay, who deserted her. She returned to London in 1795 and, following her attempted suicide, became involved with Godwin, whom she married in 1797, shortly before the birth (which proved fatal) of her daughter, the future Mary Shelley. She left several unfinished works, including <b>Maria</b>.<br><p>Janet Todd is Francis Hutcheson Professor of English Literature at the University of Glasgow and an honorary fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge.</p><br><p>Janet Todd is Francis Hutcheson Professor of English Literature at the University of Glasgow and an honorary fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge.</p></p><h2>Life, God, and Other Small Topics: Conversations from Socrates in the City</h2><p><b>This book is for the seeker in all of us, the collector of wisdom, and the person who asks, &#x201c;What if?&#x201d; from the author of <i>Bonhoeffer</i>, <i>Miracles</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Martin Luther</i></b><br><br> The Greek philosopher Socrates famously said that &#x201c;the unexamined life is not worth living.&#x201d; Using this as a starting point, Eric Metaxas created a forum encouraging successful professionals to actively think about life&#x2019;s bigger questions.

How do we reconcile common sense and science? John Searle argues vigorously that the truths of common sense and the truths of science are both right and that the only question is how to fit them together.</p><p>Searle explains how we can reconcile an intuitive view of ourselves as conscious, free, rational agents with a universe that science tells us consists of mindless physical particles. He briskly and lucidly sets out his arguments against the familiar positions in the philosophy of mind, and details the consequences of his ideas for the mind-body problem, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, questions of action and free will, and the philosophy of the social sciences.</p></p><p>John R. Searle is Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;Wittgenstein once remarked that a philosopher who doesn&#x2019;t engage in public debate is like a boxer who never enters the ring. By this standard, John Searle is a true prizefighter. In recent years he has taken on Noam Chomsky, the champion of modern linguistics; Jacques Derrida, the heavyweight of post structuralism; and endeavored to deal a knock-out blow to the pretensions of artificial intelligentsia.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Trevor Pateman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;John Searle&#x2019;s Reith lectures have been widely received as a timely expos� of those woolly-minded computer-lovers who believe that computers can think, and indeed that the human mind is just a biological computer.

Matthew does research in Paleontology, Anatomy and Zoology. His current project is "Early Evolution of Dinosaurs".</p>Gr 2-5-Opening with a lofty disclaimer ("you will find every dinosaur that has ever been discovered and verified by a dinosaur expert"), this A-Z dino dictionary offers a wide overview of the currently known genera. How the list was compiled is never explained, nor the criteria used to weed out problematic or disputed genera. Following a general introduction, the entries, from "Aardonyx" and "Abelisaurus" to "Zuniceratops," are spread out in an open, spacious layout. Many entries include a painted portrait by Baron, a smaller silhouette with a human figure for scale, the species name with pronunciation and translation, a descriptive paragraph, and four basic facts such as when the subject lived and in what country it was found. More than half of the entries, however, include neither illustration nor comment-just the header and those four sketchy facts. That doesn't leave readers much to go on-there aren't even links to related dinos or families to provide a clue to the subject's body type. Furthermore, rather than go for realistic detail, for the most part the illustrator fashions his portraits from sharp, often geometric elements and tidily variegated hues, floating stylized figures in white space or over bare hints of ground. The results are easy on the eyes but beyond basic shapes more evocative than informative.

The family&#x2019;s story starts with Hoonie, a young Korean man born with physical deformities, but whose destiny comes from his inner strength and kindness. Hoonie&#x2019;s daughter, rather than bring shame on her family, leaves their homeland for Japan, where her children and grandchildren will be born and raised; yet prejudice against their Korean heritage will prevent them from ever feeling at home. In <em>Pachinko</em>, Min Jin Lee says much about success and suffering, prejudice and tradition, but the novel never bogs down and only becomes richer, like a sauce left simmering hour after hour. Lee&#x2019;s exceptional story of one family is the story of many of the world&#x2019;s people.

Few pastors, however, are trained to recognize and deal with mental illness, and they can unintentionally give advice that is ineffective or even dangerous.<br><br>Counselor Steve Bloem fills this void by equipping pastors and other church leaders to identify the symptoms of common mental disorders, to offer biblical encouragement and comfort to those suffering from them, and to decide when to refer them to mental-health professionals.<br><br>Bloem makes a foundational biblical case for the reality and treatment of mental illnesses, and he dispels a number of myths about those who suffer from them. Drawing on extensive counseling and pastoral experience, he provides essential tools and advice for those in ministry to help people battling depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia, and other mental illnesses. Pastors, counselors, and seminary students will find this handbook to be an indispensable guide for these important issues.</p><p>Steve Bloem is a certified counselor, former pastor, and executive director of Heartfelt Counseling Ministries in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.&#x201c;I applaud Steve's courage and professionalism in coming forward with this much needed book. The church is made up of everyday, real people and mental illness is a real problem that cannot be swept under the rug. As God gave us doctors to help us with heart attacks, back surgeries, and diabetes, he also gave us doctors to help us with mental illness. Of course God can heal somebody immediately of any disease or illness, but oftentimes he uses doctors, medicine, and other tools to help. In that regard, I believe Steve's book is a godsend. It gives pastors the knowledge, information, and tools they need to successfully and confidently address this critical issue with those they oversee. God bless you Steve for having the courage to come out of the darkness and shine a light on your own experience so that others may be helped, healed, blessed, and God glorified throughout. Steve Bloem delivers the information in a way that will help pastors and impact the kingdom of God today and in the ages to come. God has used Steve's personal journey mightily to help him understand the tragedy, effects, trauma, solutions, and answers for dealing with mental illness. This book is a must read for every pastor and I believe should be taught as a course in every seminary.&#x201d; (Jack Alan Levine, Executive Pastor, Purpose Church, Orlando, Florida 2018-04-10)<br><br>&#x201c;I have been a pastor and a seminary professor for many years, and I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever encountered a book as helpful, as complete, and as biblical as Steve Bloem&#x2019;s <i>The Pastoral Handbook of Mental Illness: A Guide for Training and Reference</i>. This will become one of the most important books in your library. Steve Bloem is incredibly knowledgeable and refreshingly authentic. The compassion and sensitivity of these pages is Christlike. Get this book and, when you do, you&#x2019;ll thank me for having commended it to you.&#x201d; (Steve Brown, Professor of Practical Theology Emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary 2018-04-10)<br><br>&#x201c;In Steve Bloem&#x2019;s latest book, <i>The Pastoral Handbook of Mental Illness</i>, he draws from pastoral training and experience, plus years of professional mental health training and counseling experience to synthesize practical knowledge about mental health issues within the church that local pastors face today. Steve also gives the reader insight into his own personal struggle with mental illness and how it affected him and his family. Mental illness affects not only the individual with the diagnosis but the person&#x2019;s family as well. This book will help church leaders to better understand mental illness and how the church family can lovingly extend compassion and understanding to those who are affected by this disease.&#x201d; (Gene Pearson, Pastor of Care and Counseling, Rush Creek Bible Church, Byron Center, Michigan 2018-04-10)<br><br>&#x201c;Every pastor needs to own this book. Here&#x2019;s why. Thankfully, in recent years, our western church culture has taken some steps forward in understanding mental illness but we have a long way to go. Steve Bloem helps us move further faster by challenging us with insights from Scripture many of us have simply ignored. Yes, that&#x2019;s right, the Bible talks about mental illness and the scope is significant. In addition, this is a handbook.

P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, August Derleth, and Clark Ashton Smith, all regular contributors to the pulp magazine <i>Weird Tales</i> during the first half of the twentieth century, are recognizable even to casual readers of the bizarre and fantastic. And yet despite being more popular than them all during the golden era of genre pulp fiction, there is another author whose name and work have fallen into obscurity: Seabury Quinn. <br><br> Quinn's short stories were featured in well more than half of <i>Weird Tales</i>'s original publication run. His most famous character, the supernatural French detective Dr. Jules de Grandin, investigated cases involving monsters, devil worshippers, serial killers, and spirits from beyond the grave, often set in the small town of Harrisonville, New Jersey. In de Grandin there are familiar shades of both Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, and alongside his assistant, Dr. Samuel Trowbridge, de Grandin's knack for solving mysteries&#x2014;and his outbursts of peculiar French-isms (grand Dieu!)&#x2014;captivated readers for nearly three decades. <br> Collected for the first time in trade editions, <i>The Complete Tales of Jules de Grandin</i>, edited by George Vanderburgh, presents all ninety-three published works featuring the supernatural detective. Presented in chronological order over five volumes, this is the definitive collection of an iconic pulp hero. <br><br> The third volume, <i>The Dark Angel</i>, includes all of the Jules de Grandin stories from "The Lost Lady" (1931) to "The Hand of Glory" (1933), as well as "The Devil's Bride", the only novel featuring de Grandin, which was originally serialized over six issues of <i>Weird Tales</i>. It also includes a foreword by Darrell Schweitzer and an introduction by George Vanderburgh and Robert Weinberg.</p><p><b>Seabury Quinn</b> was a pulp magazine author, whose popular stories of the occult detective Jules de Grandin were published in <i>Weird Tales</i> between 1925 and 1951. Quinn penned ninety-two short stories and one full-length novel featuring 'the occult Hercule Poirot,' which were enormously popular with readers. Quinn lived in Washington, D.C., United States, and died in 1969.<b>Praise for the Complete Tales of Jules de Grandin</b><br><br> "<b>Hercule Poirot meets Fox Mulder</b> . . . gruesomely effective, and purists who object to detective stories with paranormal elements will find that <b>the moment each story crosses the border to the supernatural raises genuine shivers.</b>"&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> &#x201c;<b>Connoisseurs of pulp adventure . . . will be delighted.</b>&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "A collection of <b>wonderfully fun mashups.

Midwife Elspeth Howell returns home to the carnage: her husband, and four of her children, murdered. Before she can discover her remaining son Caleb, alive and hiding in the kitchen pantry, another shot rings out over the snow-covered valley. Twelve-year-old Caleb must tend to his mother until she recovers enough for them to take to the frozen wilderness in search of the men responsible.</p><p>A scorching portrait of a merciless world&#x2014;of guilt and lost innocence, atonement and retribution, resilience and sacrifice, pregnant obsession and primal adolescence&#x2014;<em>The Kept</em> introduces an old-beyond-his-years protagonist as indelible and heartbreaking as Mattie Ross of <em>True Grit</em> or Jimmy Blevins of <em>All the Pretty Horses</em>, as well as a shape-shifting mother as enigmatic and mysterious as a character drawn by Russell Banks or Marilynne Robinson.&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2014</strong>: If someone were to tell you that <em>The Kept</em> involved cross dressing and serial murder, you&#x2019;d be forgiven for thinking you&#x2019;d stumbled on a new contemporary thriller. But James Scott&#x2019;s debut, while thrilling, is set in rural upstate New York c: 1900. It tells the story of a mother and son who set off for a rough, rural town in search of the killers who murdered their family; there, they make some discoveries, all right--not just about the criminals, but also about their own damaged selves. This debut is not for the faint of heart--look for reviews that compare it to the work of Cormac (<em>The Road</em>) McCarthy. But it will grab you from the first line--&#x201c;Elspeth Howell was a sinner&#x201d;--and haunt you well past the discovery that Elspeth&#x2019;s sins are both lesser and greater than you first thought. This is one profound and disturbing book from a writer to watch. --<em>Sara Nelson</em><p>In the winter of 1897, Elspeth Howell treks across miles of snow and ice to the isolated farmstead in upstate New York where she and her husband have raised their five children. Her midwife's salary is tucked into the toes of her boots, and her pack is full of gifts for her family. But as she crests the final hill, and sees her darkened house and a smokeless chimney, immediately she knows that an unthinkable crime has destroyed the life she so carefully built.</p><p>Her lone comfort is her twelve-year-old son, Caleb, who joins her in mourning the tragedy and planning its reprisal. Their long journey leads them to a rough-hewn lake town, defined by the violence both of its landscape and of its inhabitants. There Caleb is forced into a brutal adulthood, as he slowly discovers truths about his family he never suspected, and Elspeth must confront the terrible urges and unceasing temptations that have haunted her for years. Throughout it all, the love between mother and son serves as the only shield against a merciless world.</p><p>A scorching portrait of guilt and lost innocence, atonement and retribution, resilience and sacrifice, pregnant obsession and primal adolescence, <em>The Kept </em>is told with deep compassion and startling originality, and introduces James Scott as a major new literary voice.</p></p><h2>Taking Heaven by Storm: Methodism and the Rise of Popular Christianity in America</h2><p>In 1770 there were fewer than 1,000 Methodists in America. Fifty years later, the church counted more than 250,000 adherents. Identifying Methodism as America's most significant large-scale popular religious movement of the antebellum period, John H. Wigger reveals what made Methodism so attractive to post-revolutionary America.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taking Heaven by Storm shows how Methodism fed into popular religious enthusiasm as well as the social and economic ambitions of the "middling people on the make"--skilled artisans, shopkeepers, small planters, petty merchants--who constituted its core. Wigger describes how the movement expanded its reach and fostered communal intimacy and "intemperate zeal" by means of an efficient system of itinerant and local preachers, class meetings, love feasts, quarterly meetings, and camp meetings. He also examines the important role of African Americans and women in early American Methodism and explains how the movement's willingness to accept impressions, dreams, and visions as evidence of the work and call of God circumvented conventional assumptions about education, social standing, gender, and race.<br> &nbsp;<br> A pivotal text on the role of religion in American life, Taking Heaven by Storm shows how the enthusiastic, egalitarian, entrepreneurial, lay-oriented spirit of early American Methodism continues to shape popular religion today.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>John Wigger</b> is an associate professor of history at the University of Missouri.<br><br> &nbsp;&#34;The story of [Methodism&#39;s] rise and growth has been told before, but in this new book an attempt is made to account for the movement&#39;s remarkable success, a success which in part ... was the result of Methodism&#39;s adaptability in the context of the prevailing popular religious culture in which Methodism took root.&#34; -- Kenneth Newport, Theological Book Review &#34;Stunning, magnificent, pungent, well-crafted, beautifully written, painstakingly researched, lavishly documented, careful, comprehensive, insightful, compelling... It provides the best treatment of early American Methodism (to 1820) that we have and are likely to get any time soon.&#34; - Russell E. Richey, Wesleyan/Holiness Studies Center Bulletin &#34;John Wigger has at last provided us with the wide-ranging, contextualized study of expansionary, early Methodism that we have long needed... This is a lucidly written work of scrupulous and unostentatious historical scholarship.&#34; - Richard J. Carwardine, Journal of Southern Religion &#34;Exhaustively researched, beautifully written, broad and sweeping in conception and interpretation... By far the best account of early Methodism in America.&#34; -- David Edwin Harrell, Jr., Labour History Review</p><h2>Dark Night of the Soul</h2><p>St. John of the Cross was a Carmelite friar and priest; he is renowned for his cooperation with Saint Teresa of �vila in the reformation of the Carmelite order, and for his poetry and his studies on the growth of the soul. Dark Night of the Soul is considered one of the greatest religious poems ever written. This masterpiece of Mystic Christianity examines faith and how to keep faith when all seems lost. Think of it as guide to making it through the dark night of the soul to the brighter, happier, faith filled tomorrow that awaits.</p><p></p><h2>The Raider (Highland Guard)</h2><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER � After consolidating his gains against the enemy English, King Robert the Bruce of Scotland sends his best soldiers to fortify the lawless borders.

A true patriot whose bare hands are a deadly weapon, Robbie is the fierce enforcer of the Guard, and his hatred of the English has been honed to a razor-sharp edge. But vengeance proves bittersweet when his enemy&#x2019;s beautiful sister falls into his hands and he finds himself fighting temptation&#x2014;a battle he badly wants to lose.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lady Rosalin Clifford barely recognizes the rebel prisoner she saved from execution six years ago. Though her girlish ideals for fairness have matured into a passion for justice, Rosalin believes she betrayed her brother when she helped this dangerous man escape.&nbsp; Now her traitorous act has come back to haunt her. But she can&#x2019;t deny the longing this tormented warrior ignites in her, or deny the passion that turns sworn enemies into lovers. Is the gentle love of a true English Rose enough to free Scotland&#x2019;s most brutal warrior from a path of vengeance&#x2014;before it&#x2019;s too late?<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Raider</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;McCarty&#x2019;s latest Highland Guard novel is a deeply moving and delightful read . . . once again proving that McCarty is a master storyteller.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>RT Book Reviews</i></b><br><b><i><br></i></b>&#x201c;Monica McCarty is an absolutely superior author!

He would never be able to see a razed barn without thinking of the one that had served as his father&#x2019;s funeral pyre. It had been the then seventeen-year-old Robbie&#x2019;s first lesson in English treachery and injustice. In the fifteen years since, he&#x2019;d had many more.<br><br>But it would end. By all that was holy, he would make sure of it. No matter what it took, he would see Scotland freed of its English &#x201c;overlords.&#x201d; No more sons would see their father&#x2019;s burned body hanging from the rafters, no more brothers would see their sister raped and brother executed, and no more farmers would see their farm razed and cattle stolen.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t care if he had to fight for another godforsaken fifteen years, he wouldn&#x2019;t rest until every last English occupier fled from Scotland and the Lion&#x2014;the symbol of Scotland&#x2019;s kingship&#x2014;roared free.<br><br>Freedom was the only thing he cared about. Nothing else had mattered from the first day he&#x2019;d lifted his sword to fight alongside his boyhood friend, William Wallace.<br><br>Recalling the manner of his friend&#x2019;s death, Robbie&#x2019;s jaw hardened with the steely determination born of hatred. He turned from the smoldering timbers&#x2014;the latest example of English &#x201c;justice&#x201d;&#x2014;to face the villagers who&#x2019;d cautiously begun to approach the manor house.<br><br>&#x201c;Who did this?&#x201d; he asked, the evenness of his tone not completely masking the ominous warning underneath.<br><br>But he already knew the answer. Only one man would be bold enough to defy him. Only one man had refused to renew the truce. Only one man had sent Robbie&#x2019;s missive requesting a parley back in embers.<br><br>A few of the villagers looked around before the village reeve, a farmer by the name of Murdock, cautiously stepped forward. The trepidation among the villagers wasn&#x2019;t unusual. As one of the most feared men in the Borders&#x2014;hell, in all of Christendom&#x2014;Robbie was used to it. Though his notoriety served its purpose in striking fear in the enemy, it wasn&#x2019;t without complications. It had sure as hell made keeping his identity secret as one of the members of Bruce&#x2019;s Highland Guard a challenge. Eventually he knew someone was going to recognize him, even with his features hidden. He&#x2019;d become too well known.<br><br>&#x201c;Clifford&#x2019;s men, my lord,&#x201d; Murdock explained. &#x201c;They took everything. The cattle, the grain&#x2014;even the seed&#x2014;before setting the barn afire.&#x201d;<br><br>Clifford. God&#x2019;s bones, I knew it! Robbie&#x2019;s gauntleted fists clenched at his side, rage surging through him in a powerful rush.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t often that he lost his temper. As his size and reputation alone caused hardened warriors to shake in their boots, it served no purpose.<br><br>But there were two things guaranteed to test his control: one was the English knight who stood behind him, Alex &#x201c;Dragon&#x201d; Seton, his unlikely partner in the Highland Guard, and the other was the English knight who&#x2019;d imprisoned him six years ago and seemed to be thwarting him ever since, Sir Robert Clifford, King Edward&#x2019;s new Keeper of Scotland&#x2014;in other words, Scotland&#x2019;s latest bloody overlord.<br><br>Devil take the English whoreson, Clifford would pay&#x2014;for this and for old scores as yet unsettled. It was a reckoning long overdue. For six years, the bastard had eluded him, and now Clifford&#x2019;s defiance&#x2014;his refusal to know when he&#x2019;d been beaten&#x2014;was threatening to ruin everything.<br><br>&#x201c;Take care of it, Raider,&#x201d; the king had said.<br><br>Robbie had a job to do, damn it. Bruce had put him in charge of enforcing the peace in the lawless, war-torn Borders. His war name of &#x201c;Raider&#x201d; attested to his experience in the area. The king was counting on him to bring the English barons to heel, and no one was going to stand in his way.<br><br>When King Edward left Berwick Castle last summer, forced to abandon his war against the Scots to attend to brewing trouble with his barons, Bruce had gone on the offensive, leading a series of well-executed raids into Northern England. For the first time, the English had gotten a taste of the devastating war the Scots had been experiencing for years. The raids had not only shifted the war from the burdened Scottish countryside to England, but also served to replenish the drained royal coffers by exacting payment from the Northern English barons in exchange for a truce.<br><br>The other barons had renewed their truces, but Clifford, the new governor of Berwick Castle, refused their &#x201c;offer,&#x201d; and was continuing to resist. His resistance could encourage others to do the same, and Robbie sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t going to let that happen.<br><br>Bruce would have his truce and Clifford&#x2019;s cooperation; Robbie would bloody well see to it.<br><br>James Douglas, one of the three other warriors who&#x2019;d accompanied Robbie and Seton on this &#x201c;simple, straightforward&#x201d; mission (as if such a thing existed) to collect the feudal dues owed the king, muttered an expletive, echoing his thoughts a bit more crudely.<br><br>If anyone hated King Edward&#x2019;s new &#x201c;Keeper&#x201d; more than Robbie, it was Douglas. Clifford had made his name and fortune by the war in Scotland in part by laying claim to Douglas&#x2019;s lands.<br><br>&#x201c;There is nothing left?&#x201d; Douglas asked the farmer, his face growing dark with anger.<br><br>The Black Douglas hadn&#x2019;t earned his epitaph only for the color of his hair but also for his fearsome reputation. Mistaking the source of his rage, Murdock&#x2019;s hands shook as he tried to explain. &#x201c;Nay, my lord. They took everything. Claimed it was the cost of dealing with &#x2018;the rebels.&#x2019; They would have burned the entire village if we refused. We had no choice but to give it to them. It&#x2019;s the same everywhere. Clifford&#x2019;s men raided the entire Eastern March from here to Berwick. The reeve at Duns sent a warning this morning, but it came too late.&#x201d;<br><br>Robbie swore. Damn the bastard to hell!<br><br>&#x201c;Was anyone hurt?&#x201d; Seton asked.<br><br>The farmer shook his head. &#x201c;Nay, praise God. It&#x2019;s only the barn they destroyed&#x2014;this time. But the fire was a warning. It&#x2019;s because they know we were dealing with Bruce that they came.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Bruce is your king,&#x201d; Robbie reminded him pointedly. In this part of Scotland, so near the English border, the people often needed it. Though Bruce had established his kingship north of the Tay, there were many in the south who reluctantly called Bruce king and whose sympathies still lay with the English.<br><br>Speaking of Scots who acted like Englishmen, Seton, whose lands in Scotland lay near here, jumped to the farmer&#x2019;s defense. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Murdock meant no offense to the king. He was only pointing out the difficulty for those who live surrounded by English garrisons with no one to defend them.&#x201d;<br><br>Boyd looked at him sharply, not missing the implied criticism. Seton often bemoaned the &#x201c;damned-if-they-do, damned-if-they-don&#x2019;t&#x201d; situation of the people who lived so near England. But everyone had to make a choice: for England or for Scotland; there was no straddling both sides of the line. Seton still didn&#x2019;t understand that he couldn&#x2019;t live in both worlds.<br><br>&#x201c;Damnation.&#x201d; Douglas swore in frustration. &#x201c;The king is counting on that grain and cattle. What the hell is he supposed to feed his men?&#x201d;<br><br>The Bruce and a good portion of his army (and the Highland Guard when they weren&#x2019;t on other missions) had been laying siege to Dundee Castle for the past three months. With Edward in London and the threat of war abated, Bruce&#x2019;s focus had shifted to clearing the entrenched English garrisons from Scotland&#x2019;s castles.<br><br>It was the only way the war could truly be won. All the victories and momentum of the past few years wouldn&#x2019;t mean shite if the English continued to occupy their castles.<br><br>And they were making progress. Linlithgow had fallen after the raids last year, and Dundee was close. But all of it would soon come to a quick end if Robbie didn&#x2019;t do his job. The king was without funds, and with the required hundred days of free feudal service of many of the soldiers nearly up, if the siege were to continue, they had to find coin to pay the men and food to feed them.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t much of an overstatement to say that the future of the war rested on Robbie&#x2019;s shoulders. And if the path to victory depended on securing protective truces from the English barons who&#x2019;d raided Scotland for years, he was damned glad to do it.<br><br>&#x201c;The king will have his food,&#x201d; Robbie said flatly. And his damned truce with Clifford.<br><br>Douglas guessed what he meant, a slow smile spreading over his dark visage. Seton did as well, but his reaction was to clench his jaw as if he wanted to argue but knew it would do no good. Maybe he&#x2019;d learned something the past seven years after all.<br><br>Clifford had thrown down the gauntlet, and Robbie sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t going to let it go unanswered.<br><br>Murdock, however, didn&#x2019;t understand. &#x201c;But how? There is nothing left and they will only come again. You have to do something.&#x201d;<br><br>Robbie leveled his gaze on the farmer. &#x201c;I intend to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; the farmer asked.<br><br>He would fight fire with fire, and strike in a place his enemy could not ignore. Something rare appeared on his face when the corners of his mouth lifted in a smile. &#x201c;Take it back.&#x201d;<br><br>Berwick Castle, English Marches, One Week Later<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t fair, Aunt Rosie-lin.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin looked down at the small, upturned face, at the cherubic features twisted with hurt, disappointment, and disbelief, and felt her insides melt.<br><br>Cliff&#x2019;s seven-year-old daughter, Margaret, had come bursting into Rosalin&#x2019;s solar almost in tears a few moments ago. Rosalin tried not to show her shock at her niece&#x2019;s attire. The poor thing was fighting so hard not to cry, she didn&#x2019;t want to push her over the edge.<br><br>Sitting down on the edge of the bed, she patted the space beside her. &#x201c;Come sit, Margaret, and tell me what has happened.&#x201d;<br><br>Sensing that she&#x2019;d found a pair of sympathetic ears, Margaret did as she bid, hopping up and settling in on the fluffy feather mattress next to her.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Meg,&#x201d; she corrected, wrinkling her nose with distaste. &#x201c;No one but Father calls me Margaret.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin&#x2019;s mouth twisted, trying not to smile. Instead, she nodded solemnly. &#x201c;Forgive me, Meg.&#x201d;<br><br>The little girl rewarded her with a tremulous smile, and Rosalin melted a little more.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; Meg assured her, patting her hand as if their ages were reversed. &#x201c;You only just got here, and you haven&#x2019;t seen me since I was little.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin pretended to cough.<br><br>Meg&#x2019;s tiny, delicately arched brows drew together over an equally tiny nose. &#x201c;Are you sickly?&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin couldn&#x2019;t hide that smile. &#x201c;Nay, Meg. I&#x2019;m perfectly hale.&#x201d;<br><br>The little girl studied her. &#x201c;Good. Andrew is always coughing, and he isn&#x2019;t allowed to play outside. He&#x2019;s no fun.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin felt a sharp stab in her chest but tried not to let her fear show. Cliff&#x2019;s three-year-old son Andrew had always been frail. Though no one spoke of it, he was not expected to see beyond his childhood.<br><br>Glad that the little girl was no longer close to tears, even if she couldn&#x2019;t say the same, Rosalin asked, &#x201c;So why don&#x2019;t you tell me why you are wearing breeches and a lad&#x2019;s surcoat?&#x201d;<br><br>Meg looked down as if she&#x2019;d forgotten. &#x201c;John said I&#x2019;d get in the way.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin didn&#x2019;t follow. &#x201c;In the way . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>Meg gave her a little frown of impatience, as if she hadn&#x2019;t been paying proper attention. &#x201c;Of riding lessons. Father gave John a horse for his saint&#x2019;s day last week, and today he begins his training with Roger and Simon. It isn&#x2019;t fair. John is two years younger than I am. I want to train like a knight, too. He can barely pick up the wooden sword Father gave him. How&#x2019;s he supposed to kill bloody Scots if he can&#x2019;t lift a sword?&#x201d; Rosalin coughed again and made a note to tell Cliff to have care of his language around Meg. &#x201c;He shouldn&#x2019;t have told Father when I borrowed it. No one likes a tale-teller.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin was having a hard time keeping up, so she just nodded.<br><br>The little girl&#x2019;s face crumpled. &#x201c;Roger wouldn&#x2019;t let me stay, even when you can see my skirts won&#x2019;t get in the way. I don&#x2019;t want to sew with Idonia and mother. Why won&#x2019;t they let me train with them?&#x201d;<br><br>Because you&#x2019;re a girl. But as it didn&#x2019;t seem the right time to explain the harsh truth of the sexes, Rosalin gathered the sobbing child in her arms and sighed. She understood her pain. She, too, had wanted to be with her brother&#x2014;probably even more so, since he was all she had. Learning that she couldn&#x2019;t simply because she was a girl had been a bitter draught to swallow.<br><br>Riding, practicing swordplay, and running around outside had seemed vastly preferable to sitting inside with a needle and lute. Of course, that was much too simplistic a view of their respective roles, but at Meg&#x2019;s age, she had seen it the same way.<br><br>After a moment, the little girl looked up at her, her long, dark lashes framing big, blue eyes damp with tears. She might look like her pretty, dark-haired mother, but Rosalin saw Cliff&#x2019;s stubbornness in the firm set of her chin. &#x201c;Will you talk to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to whom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Father. He&#x2019;ll listen to you. Everyone says he&#x2019;s never refused you anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin laughed. &#x201c;I assure you, he&#x2019;s refused me plenty. I wanted to ride and practice with a sword, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Margaret&#x2019;s eyes widened to almost comical proportions. &#x201c;You did?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye. And I thought it just as unfair as you when he told me no.&#x201d;<br><br>The smile that spread across the little girl&#x2019;s face was almost blinding. &#x201c;You did? He did?&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin nodded, then paused for a moment to think. &#x201c;What would you say if I took you on a ride tomorrow and let you practice by holding the reins?&#x201d;<br><br>It clearly wasn&#x2019;t what Meg hoped to hear, but after a moment of disappointment, she decided to take what she could get and negotiate for better terms. Perhaps the little girl was like her aunt in that regard.<br><br>&#x201c;For how long?&#x201d; Meg asked.<br><br>&#x201c;As long as you like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where can we go?&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalin paused, considering. She didn&#x2019;t want to venture far. &#x201c;Your mother said there was a fair at Norham tomorrow. Would you like to go to that?&#x201d;<br><br>Meg nodded enthusiastically and a moment later, she was running from the room, eager to lord her upcoming adventure over her siblings.<br><br>Rosalin called her back. &#x201c;Meg!&#x201d;<br><br>The little girl turned around questioningly.<br><br>&#x201c;Wear a gown,&#x201d; Rosalin said with a smile.<br><br>Meg broke out in a wide grin, nodded, and skipped away.<br><br>A few hours later, Rosalin tracked down her very busy brother to inform him of her plan. She stood outside the door of the solar while he finished with his men.<br><br>As the newly appointed governor of Berwick Castle, Cliff had taken over the royal apartments and was using one of the receiving rooms as a council chamber.<br><br>She was so proud of him.

In his paintings, drawings and sculptures, powetry and an extraordinary aesthetic sensitivity combine with references to ancient mythology and the experiences of the modern individual. Published in 2002, this volume assembles more than forty writings on Cy Twombly starting with his first solo exhibition in 1951: poems, philosophical and scholarly essays, as well as comments by fellow artists form an anthology that relates the history of culture in the second half of the 20th century. Edited by Nicola del Roscio, it includes writings by Roland Barthes, Arthur C. Danto, Charles Olson, Robert Motherwell, Octavio Paz, Robert Rauschenberg, Pierre Restany, David Sylvester, Kirk Varnedoe and many more. Beautifully illustrated with the artist&#39;s most important works, this large-size volume is literally the &#34;textbook&#34; to understanding this most fascinating contemporary artist.</p><p>Born in 1928 in Lexington, Virginia, Twombly studied art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston the Art Students League, New York and Black Mountain College in North Carolina. In the mid 1950s, following travels in Europe and Africa, Twombly emerged as a prominent figure among a group of artists working in New York that included Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. In 1959, Twombly settled permanently in Rome. He has had numerous one-person exhibitions internationally and has been the subject of major retrospectives in both Europe and America.</p><h2>War Nerd</h2><p>Self-described war nerd Gary Brecher knows he&#x2019;s not alone, that there&#x2019;s a legion of fat, lonely Americans, stuck in stupid, paper-pushing desk jobs, who get off on reading about war because they hate their lives. But Brecher writes about war, too. <i>War Nerd</i> collects his most opinionated, enraging, enlightening, and entertaining pieces. Part war commentator, part angry humorist �la Bill Hicks, Brecher inveighs against pieties of all stripes Liberian generals, Dick Cheney, U.N. peacekeepers, the neo-cons and the massive incompetence of military powers. A provocative free thinker, he finds much to admire in the most unlikely places, and not always for the most pacifistic reasons: the Tamil Tigers, the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Danes of 1,000 years ago, and so on, across the globe and through the centuries. Crude, scatological, un-P.C., yet deeply informed, Brecher provides a radically different, completely unvarnished perspective on the nature of warfare.</p><p></p><h2>The Leopold and Loeb Files: An Intimate Look at One of America&#39;s Most Infamous Crimes</h2><p>In 1924, University of Chicago students Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were young, rich, and looking for a thrill. The crime that came next&#x2014;the brutal, cold-blood murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks&#x2014;would come to captivate the country and unfold into what many dubbed the crime of the century. As the decades passed, the mythology surrounding the unlikely killers continued to capture the interest of new generations, spawning numerous books, fictionalizations, and dramatizations.<br><br>In <i>The Leopold and Loeb Files</i>, author Nina Barrett returns to the primary sources&#x2014;confessions, interrogation transcripts, psychological reports, and more&#x2014;the kind of rare, pre-computer court documents that were usually destroyed as a matter of course. Until now, these documents have not been part of the murder&#x2019;s central narrative. This first-of-its-kind approach allows readers to view the case through a keyhole and look past all of the stories that have been spun in the last 90 years to focus on the heart of the crime.<br><br>Carefully curated and steeped in historical context from Barrett, this book allows the surviving Leopold and Loeb documents, most of which are in the form of either transcripts or narrative, to function as both artifact and literature, recounting the moves of the murder and sentencing hearing as well as addressing the questions that continue to fascinate&#x2014;issues of morality, sanity, sexuality, religious assimilation, parental grief and responsibility, remorse, and the use of the death penalty.<br><br>This comprehensive, ephemera-driven history allows the reader to act as a fly on the wall and speaks powerfully to the unsolved mysteries of this distinct crime, in which the guilt of the perpetrators is unambiguous but almost everything else is open to interpretation.</p><p><b>Nina Barrett</b>, a graduate of both Yale University and the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, is the author of three books and numerous articles, essays, and reviews. Her work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>The Nation</i>, among other places. In 2009, she curated an exhibition for Northwestern called <i>The Murder That Wouldn&#x2019;t Die</i>, which inspired <i>The Leopold and Loeb Files</i>. Barrett is also the founder and owner of Bookends &amp; Beginnings, an independent bookstore in Evanston, Illinois.Introduction<br><br> Like archaeologists, who spend the bulk of their time sifting through sand and dirt for fragments of artifacts they hope will help reconstruct history, archivists perform a lot of manual and, on the whole, rather routine labor. They empty home attics and institutional basements of boxes of old folders, notebooks, and correspondence, most of which would bore a general audience to tears unless mined some day by an inspired researcher who can spin documentary evidence into a compelling story. But every once in a while, just as an archaeologist happens upon the remains of a lost city or the unidentified tomb of a pharaoh, an archivist makes a sensational find: the documentary evidence for a famous story that has already entered the realm of myth.<br><br> In June of 1988, Kevin Leonard, then assistant university archivist at Northwestern University Library, made such a discovery. He&#x2019;d been sent down from Evanston to the Law School on the university&#x2019;s Chicago campus to pick up the school&#x2019;s administrative records from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were stored in a vault in the Law School&#x2019;s basement, in walls of boxes that Leonard and a colleague spent all day lugging out to a van and shuttling back to Evanston every time the van filled up. It was dirty, physically demanding work, and toward the end of the day Leonard was tired and starting to worry about getting the last load packed up and making it back to Evanston in time to return the van. By then, sorting the boxes he wanted from those with no foreseeable archival value, he had cleared a path to the back wall of the vault&#x2014;also a path backwards in time, to where the vault&#x2019;s earliest deposits had been placed. There in a back corner on the floor was a brown paper bag, its top rolled closed. Leonard wasn&#x2019;t sure he wanted to open it; he was in a hurry now, and he also suffers from arachnophobia, the morbid fear of spiders, and he could just imagine what might be crawling around in there after the many years the bag must have been lying on the basement floor. But then his archival instinct got the better of him&#x2014;surely no one had looked inside the bag in decades&#x2014;and he stooped down, unrolled the top, and gingerly reached inside.<br><br> The first item he pulled out was a neatly typed note on a yellowed sheet of paper that read like something from a piece of early twentieth century detective fiction. &#x201c;Dear Sir,&#x201d; it began. &#x201c;As you no doubt know by this time your son has been kidnapped. Allow us to assure you that he is at present well and safe.&#x201d; The words did not immediately ring a bell with Leonard, but the next item he pulled from the bag caused an instant shock of comprehension. It was the note&#x2019;s envelope, also yellowed, marked special delivery, and hand-addressed in block letters to MR. JACOB FRANKS, 5052 ELLIS AVE, CITY. It was postmarked May 21, 1924.<br><br> Born in Chicago and well steeped in its lore, Leonard knew exactly who Mr. Jacob Franks was, and knew as well that by the time Franks&#x2019;s trembling hands had opened this very envelope on the morning of May 22, his son Robert was already dead, and what was to become the most famous murder case in Chicago&#x2014;and possibly American&#x2014;history had already been set in motion. The brutal and senseless murder of 14-year-old Bobby Franks; the hunt for his killers; their identification as two wealthy, privileged, brilliant University of Chicago law students named Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb; and the subsequent legal drama in which celebrity attorney Clarence Darrow stepped in to rescue the killers from the gallows&#x2014;all of this had been an international news sensation in that summer of 1924.<br><br> Quickly dubbed the &#x201c;Crime of the Century,&#x201d; the case has indeed continued to haunt the American psyche throughout subsequent decades, even as other sensational murders have competed for its dubious tagline. Since that summer&#x2019;s orgy of newspaper coverage, the story has been revived again and again in book, film, and theatrical narratives and interpretations, including Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s 1948 psychological thriller <i>Rope</i>; Meyer Levin&#x2019;s best-selling 1956 novel <i>Compulsion</i> (also made into a play and a film); Stephen Dolginoff&#x2019;s dark 2003 musical <i>Thrill Me</i>; and nonfiction accounts like Hal Higdon&#x2019;s <i>Leopold and Loeb: The Crime of the Century</i> (1975, 1999) and Simon Baatz&#x2019;s <i>For the Thrill of It</i> (2008).<br><br> From the moment of their remarkable and remarkably detailed twin confessions in police custody ten days after the murder, the guilt of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb has never been in question. In that sense, the crime was only very briefly a mystery. Yet its persistent fascination lies in its essentially inscrutable nature, which both demands yet somehow ultimately evades all attempts at satisfactory explanation. With each retelling the story has become even more&#x2014;rather than less&#x2014;mythological. As historian Paula S. Fass has written, &#x201c;Because the case and the protagonists were rapidly engulfed in the evolving public discourse and the stories were vivid, the public portrayals overwhelmed the identity of the individual characters. When Leopold eventually wrote his own memoirs he had difficulty distinguishing the fact from the fiction of his own identity, so completely had he and the story in which he had participated been enveloped and defined in the public spaces of the culture.&#x201d;<br><br> This makes Leonard&#x2019;s discovery in the basement of the Law School even more extraordinary. For the ransom note&#x2014;a chilling and creepy artifact of the case, but not an especially illuminating one&#x2014;was not the only contents of the paper bag. Also inside were three bulkier and even more astounding documents. There was a black cardboard binder enclosing a 517-page document labeled <i>Confessions and Other Statements of Leopold and Loeb</i>. This proved to be an original carbon copy of the transcript of the statements made by the killers in police custody beginning the night before they actually confessed. It begins with the interrogation period during which they were still trying to outwit their questioners and documents the steps by which they were cornered into telling the truth. Then, in addition to the actual confessions, it covers a session in which each of their confessions was read aloud before the other, giving the other a chance to address their discrepancies; and much of the subsequent day on which detectives took Leopold and Loeb, along with a convoy of enthralled newspaper reporters, on a bizarre field trip to several of the key locations mentioned in their accounts to confirm the details of their stories.<br><br> Heavily leaked to reporters almost instantaneously, these statements formed the basis for the characterizations of Leopold and Loeb that sprang to life in the papers and have endured ever since, especially Leopold&#x2019;s cold intellectual brilliance, his supposed mastery of 15 languages, his interest in pornographic literature, and the implication of a sexual relationship between him and Loeb. And they preserve verbatim each boy&#x2019;s first-person account of the murder of Bobby Franks, including the only major point on which they vehemently contradicted one another: who had physically committed the murder.<br><br> The other two documents Leonard found in the bag were twin bound copies of the reports submitted by the team of psychiatrists summoned by Clarence Darrow to assess the sanity of the boys. Darrow was hoping for one of two outcomes that might help his case: either evidence that might support an insanity defense, or evidence of some mental disease or medical abnormality that might mitigate the sentencing. Therefore these reports contain a wealth of information about the killers&#x2019; physical health and history as well as the results of exhaustive inquiries into their psychological and especially their fantasy lives. They also contain details about the murder not included in the confessions, and intimate portraits of the boys&#x2019; families, education, and upbringing.<br><br> Later connecting the contents of this mysterious bag with the contents of a box he had found nearby in the vault, Kevin Leonard realized that all these materials had been in the possession of Harold Hulbert, a member of the team of psychiatrists hired by Darrow. The box contained materials related to another murder case in which Hulbert had been a consulting psychiatrist, as well as correspondence from Hulbert stating his intention to bequeath the evidence from several of his most interesting cases to Northwestern.<br><br> Now cataloged in the Archives, the papers complement another remarkable collection of materials related to Leopold and Loeb that had also been bequeathed to Northwestern and are housed in the library&#x2019;s McCormick Library of Special Collections. These are the papers of Elmer Gertz, the Chicago attorney who secured Nathan Leopold&#x2019;s eventual parole in 1958, despite his &#x201c;life plus 99 years&#x201d; sentence. Gertz had acquired a wealth of documents relating to the original crime&#x2014;including, most spectacularly, a 4411-page transcript of the court case in which Darrow faced off against State&#x2019;s Attorney Robert Crowe to try to persuade Judge John Caverly that Leopold and Loeb should not receive the death penalty. In addition to preserving a raw portrait of the rhetorically brilliant Darrow at work, the transcript includes the testimony of nearly a hundred witnesses, and constitutes a record of one of the earliest court cases in which psychiatric evidence was extensively used to influence sentencing. <br><br> Gertz&#x2019;s papers also contain revealing drafts of Leopold&#x2019;s statements made during various parole appeals, assessing his role in the murder from an adult perspective, and scores of fan letters sent to Leopold in prison following the publication of his memoir, <i>Life Plus 99 Years</i>. The voluminous Gertz-Leopold correspondence, which grew more intimate as the years went by, also provides a revealing glimpse of Leopold&#x2019;s post-prison years, which he spent as privately as he could manage in Puerto Rico&#x2014;sometimes seeming to struggle with his newfound fame as America&#x2019;s most rehabilitated criminal.<br><br> In the spring of 2009, I curated an exhibit called &#x201c;The Murder that Wouldn&#x2019;t Die: Leopold &amp; Loeb in Artifact, Fact, and Fiction&#x201d; at Northwestern University Library. Items from both the Hulbert and Gertz collections were displayed&#x2014;including the ransom note, the Confessions, the psychiatric reports, and the court transcripts&#x2014;along with books, DVDs, CDs, theatrical programs and posters, and other memorabilia relating to works based on the case.<br><br> The response to the exhibit was immediate and extraordinary: instant confirmation that this murder really hasn&#x2019;t ever died, either in the local or national consciousness. There was television, radio, newspaper, and magazine coverage, including a <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i> magazine excerpt from the Confessions in which both Leopold and Loeb are confronted by a psychiatrist about whether they understood that the murder was morally wrong. Two theatrical companies that happened to be in the rehearsal stages for Leopold-and-Loeb-related productions brought their cast and crew to do background research. (One of the productions was of <i>Rope</i>, the other of <i>Never the Sinner</i>, the debut work by Academy Award-winning screenwriter John Logan, which was based on research he did in the Gertz collection as a Northwestern undergraduate.)<br><br> But the most remarkable response came from people still claiming&#x2014;more than eight decades later&#x2014;some personal connection to the case. There was a visitor in his 90s who told me he&#x2019;d been a classmate of Bobby Franks at the Harvard School, and still remembered seeing both Leopold and Loeb around the neighborhood in the week between the murder and their arrests; several contacts by people claiming to own artifacts from the Loeb mansion, which had stood vacant but still furnished for many years before being demolished; and, toward the end of the exhibit&#x2019;s run, several descendants from one of the families, who came hoping there might be something in one of these documents that finally made sense of what their infamous ancestor had done.<br><br> But an exhibit can only display the documents as artifacts, not as texts. This book invites the reader inside their pages. It can be read as an introduction to the case, but my hope is also that readers who have encountered the story in its many other forms might gain additional perspective by seeing it unfold in the words of the original participants&#x2014;and through the eyes of the world that was watching.</p><h2>Inspired by Endangered Species: Animals and Plants in Fabric Perspectives</h2><p>Lively, colorful, and skillfully made fabric &#x201c;portraits&#x201d; of 182 endangered species bring them to real, vibrant life.

Does occupying the top of life&#x2019;s heap mean you have it? Does being near the bottom mean you don&#x2019;t? Wisdom can certainly help you acquire wealth, influence people, or succeed at your career, yet it involves more than knowledge alone. It&#x2019;s also a matter of understanding God&#x2019;s perspectives in applying what you know and having the character to act accordingly. That is why true wisdom&#x2015;the kind that begins with fear of the Lord&#x2015;frequently runs counter to what our culture values and applauds. This is the wisdom the book of Proverbs teaches. Proverbs deals with the relationship between heaven and earth on a practical level that covers the broad swath of human activity. We could all use more wisdom in our lives; the book of Proverbs was designed to guide us into it. Proverbs is far from monolithic. It has multiple authors and employs diverse styles. But its goal remains simple: to equip us for living in a way that succeeds first and foremost in God&#x2019;s eyes.Exploring the links between the Bible and our own times, Paul Koptak shares perspectives on Proverbs that reveal ageless truths for our twenty-first-century lives.Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. They focus on the original meaning of the passage but don&#x2019;t discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable&#x2015;but the job is only half done!The NIV Application Commentary Series helps bring both halves of the interpretive task together. This unique, award-winning series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into our present-day context. It explains not only what the Bible meant but also how it speaks powerfully today.</p><p>Paul E.

An attorney and single mother, Nina isn't afraid to tackle the toughest cases and trickiest defenses. But she is wholly unprepared for her latest client&#x2014;sixteen-year-old Nicole Zack, rebel, thief, and best friend of Nina's teenage son, Bob.<br><br>Did Nikki steal something from her uncle, a prominent plastic surgeon, then kill him in cold blood? To find out, Nina calls in Paul van Wagoner, a P.I. and ex-lover whose bravado conceals a troubling personal secret. <br><br>As Paul investigates the eerily coincidental death of the surgeon's son&#x2014; killed in a plane crash the same night his father was murdered&#x2014;Nina sorts through the twisting lies surrounding Nikki, uncovering a seething mystery, some enraged former patients, and two very old crimes.<br><br>Finally, Nina must confront the central question she must answer in order to save her client: What did Nikki really see the night of her uncle's murder?</p><p>Defense attorney Nina Reilly has bad luck with men: one marriage ended abruptly, and another ended in tragedy. Still, her misfortunes with the opposite sex are nothing compared to the trouble she has finding a decent client. In her sixth outing, <i>Move to Strike</i>, Nina's defending a minor who's a major pain: Nikki Zack, a mouthy, rebellious teenager who's being tried as an adult in the murder of her uncle, a wealthy plastic surgeon. Like a lot of people in Lake Tahoe, Nikki disliked Bill Sykes, who showed both greed and snobbery to Nikki and her scatterbrained mother, Daria. He discouraged their familial overtures except when he cheated them in a land deal. Nevertheless, Nikki claims she didn't kill him, even though she was spotted sneaking around his pool on the night of the murder, and the prosecution's case against her is based on a blood sample that indicates she wielded the murder weapon. Nina is particularly struck by two strange facts: Sykes's son Chris was killed in a plane crash at almost the same time Sykes died, and Sykes's widow, Beth, is almost abnormally quick to front the money for her niece's defense, no questions asked. <p> Nina knows Nikki saw something or someone at Sykes's house, but she's not sure whether Nikki's protecting her sleazy, housebreaking boyfriend or Daria, whose vagueness is almost too extreme to believe. Nikki is placed under house arrest, but that's not enough to keep her--or Nina and her son Bob--safe when a stranger starts calling. When the treasure trove of unimpressive-looking rocks that Nikki took from Sykes's underwater hiding place turns out to be something completely unexpected, the ring of suspects widens and danger creeps closer. Nina teams with Paul van Wagoner, the investigator (familiar from <i>Acts of Malice</i> and previous Nina Reilly mysteries) she can't quite seem to disentangle herself from, to help sort the loose ends from the dead ends. And there are plenty of both.</p><p> The O'Shaughnessy sisters (Perri is a pen name for Pamela and Mary) are taking new risks and increasing the stakes with every book, and <i>Move to Strike</i> shows they can pull it off. The characters are deftly drawn and the plotting masterfully complex. The pacing falls a bit short of heart-stopping; the courtroom scenes serve to up the stakes for Nikki, yet don't really add much tension. But this series is still young and keeps getting better and better.

Jarvis, Director of the National Parks Service*</b><br>� Celebrates the dedicated men and women of our National Park Service (NPS) who have safeguarded the nation&#x2019;s natural legacy for 100 years<br><br>� 2016 marks the 100th anniversary of the creation of the National Park Service<br><br>� 125 images including many archival photos<br>Anyone who has stood beneath a redwood, neck craned to see its top rising far above; or who has heard ghostly whispers of residents long-past among the burnt-red cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde; or who has climbed the stairs to gaze out from the Statue of Liberty&#x2019;s crown, would agree that our National Park system is a source of pride and wonder.<br>But 100 years ago, creating a bureau to administer America&#x2019;s vast and diverse parks was a concept requiring great debate and persuasion. The story of the National Park Service is the story of people who fought for the protection of the places that have helped to define our national identity, those places we now hold dear&#x2015;from the blue hazy mist that hangs over Great Smokey Mountains National Park to the spouting geysers of Yellowstone to the thick, steamy waterways of the Everglades. The NPS founders were the architects of our family vacations, the inventors of icons with worldwide appeal. They battled &#x201c;progress,&#x201d; which often masked greed and ignorance, and their story continues with those who molded and grew the NPS through a flu pandemic, the Great Depression, World Wars, and beyond.<br><i>Prophets and Moguls, Rangers and Rogues, Bison and Bears</i> is the engaging and accessible story of the NPS that brings to life its history and characters. The result of extensive research, dozens of interviews with Park Service employees, and the author&#x2019;s own experiences at park units she visited all over the country, it&#x2019;s a highly readable history that connects the dots of past to present and will remind readers of the vast array of public assets administered by the NPS&#x2015;resources which offer something for everyone and also need every citizen&#x2019;s support.<br><p></p><br><br><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p> Mountaineers Books is proud to support the work of the National Park Foundation</p><p>Heather Hansen is a reporter specializing in environmental and travel journalism.

But the brutal reality of the war as endured by combat infantrymen has remained little documented. In <i>Foot Soldier</i>, Roscoe C. Blunt provides an all-too-rare glimpse into the experience of fighting at the Allied front. Nineteen-year-old "Rockie" arrived on the continent in November 1944, when burnt-out U.S. vehicles still littered the beaches. His 84th Infantry Division fought at the Roer, through the Battle of the Bulge, and at the crossing of the Rhine all the way to the Elbe; he was briefly taken prisoner by an SS Panzer unit. Drawing upon his numerous letters home and the journals he scrawled in foxholes and tents, he has given us one of the most detailed, immediate accounts of the Second World War ever written, a memoir sure to take its place among the classics of war literature.</p><p>What was daily life like for a lowly infantryman during the last year of World War II in the European theater? <i>Foot Soldier</i>, Roscoe C. Blunt's memoir, tells us with unadorned candor. "Rockie" Blunt, a front line soldier with the 84th Infantry Division, fought in the Roer and the Battle of the Bulge. He suffered frostbite, severe trauma, killed many enemy soldiers, and was, briefly, taken prisoner. Blunt concentrates on the quotidian: digging foxholes in frozen earth, sleeplessness, meager meals, shelterless winter bivouacs, and exhausting marches. By the war's end, Blunt is less disturbed by the sight of battlefield dead than he is elated by the discovery of fresh-baked baguettes. <i>Foot Soldier</i>, self-effacing and infused with a healthy skepticism about "the brass," is a rough-edged marriage of Studs Terkel's <i>Working</i> and Stephen Crane's <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i><b>Roscoe C. Blunt, Jr.,</b> was the youngest soldier to be awarded the Expert Infantry Badge. He also received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.

The book begins with David Plante&#x2019;s portrait of Jean Rhys in her old age, when the publication of <i>The Wide Sargasso Sea</i>, after years of silence that had made Rhys&#x2019;s great novels of the 1920s and &#x2019;30s as good as unknown, had at last gained genuine recognition for her. Rhys, however, can hardly be said to be enjoying her new fame. A terminal alcoholic, she curses and staggers and rants like King Lear on the heath in the hotel room that she has made her home, while Plante looks impassively on. Sonia Orwell is his second subject, a suave exploiter and hapless victim of her beauty and social prowess, while the unflappable, brilliant, and impossibly opinionated Germaine Greer sails through the final pages, ever ready to set the world, and any erring companion, right.</p><p><b>David Plante</b> is the author of several novels, including his lauded Francoeur Trilogy &#x2014;<i>The Family</i>, <i>The Country</i>, and <i>The Woods</i>. He has also written several works of nonfiction in addition to <i>Difficult Women</i>, most recently <i>The Pure Lover</i>, <i>Becoming a Londoner</i>, and <i>Worlds Apart</i>.<br><br><b>Scott Spencer</b> has written eleven novels, including <i>Endless Love</i>, <i>Walking the Dead</i>, and the forthcoming <i>River Under the Road</i>.

He lives in upstate New York.&#x201c;<i>Difficult Women</i> is creepy, it is cruel, it is morally indefensible &#x2014; and it is exhilarating....There may be no defending these heartless portrayals, but there&#x2019;s also no denying their power. Each scene is expertly staged, and burns with the same dark excitement you find in Mary Gaitskill&#x2019;s fiction or Harold Pinter&#x2019;s plays, the feeling that these characters have sought one another out to exercise hidden fears and desires, to expose primal wounds. " &#x2014;Parul Sehgal, <i>The New York Times </i><br><br>&#x201c;A delicious sequence of character sketches, interrupted by the occasional self-interrogatory aside....the book succeeds because the women are so horribly alive.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christine Smallwood, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Like its three subjects, <i>Difficult Women </i>is consistently interesting. It&#x2019;s as if Mr. Plante were staring out over a wild and rugged topography of femaleness and wondering how one lives in such a land. It&#x2019;s a good question and a good book.&#x201d; &#x2014;Anatole Broyard, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;The memoir of Jean Rhys . . . is a remarkable achievement. . . . Plante never forgot who Jean Rhys really was and what made her valuable, so that while he captures neatly the shabby dishevelment of the narcissistic girlwoman fallen into confused old age, he also achieves full recognition for the writer whose eloquence and maturity are endlessly redeeming. . . .

A year before, a stunning Swedish student disappeared from Oxfordshire, leaving behind a rucksack with her identification. As the lady was dishy, young, and traveling alone, the Thames Valley Police suspected foul play. But without a body, and with precious few clues, the investigation ground to a halt. Now it seems that someone who can hold back no longer is composing clue-laden poetry that begins an enthusiastic correspondence among England's news-reading public. Not one to be left behind, Morse writes a letter of his own--and follows a twisting path through the Wytham Woods that leads to a most shocking murder.Colin Dexter has won many awards for his novels including the CWA Gold Dagger and Silver Dagger awards.

A self-described research junkie, she has parlayed her interest in police procedure, cutting edge forensics and twisted plots into a streak of eleven bestselling suspense novels, including her most recent release, <em> Love You More</em>.&nbsp; <strong></strong> <p><strong>Lisa Gardner:</strong> First, the question I&#x2019;ve always wanted to ask another author: Where do you get your ideas?</p> <p><strong> Andrew Gross:</strong> It's just that if I told you I&#x2019;d have to kill you Lisa, and you're so nice... Actually, as we both know, that process varies, and every author has his or her own path. You just pray like hell they come when you need them!</p> <p>For me, this is the hardest and most stressful hurdle in what I do. The writing comes easy! For my last three books, I took conspiratorial headlines from the news&#x2014;Iraq War scandals; people who used 9/11 to disappear from their life; the Wall Street financial meltdown&#x2014;and wrapped them around more local and personal stories: a harrowing home invasion gone tragically wrong or a wife who wakes up one day to find her dead husband wasn't at all the person she thought she knew. Stories that I thought could achieve the emotional resonance I strive for in my books.</p> <p><em>Eyes Wide Open</em> took shape from two real life events straight from my own past. One was the sad suicide of my young nephew, a troubled kid, who was found at the bottom of a landmark cliff in central California. The second was a chance encounter forty years ago with none other than, ahem, Charles Manson! You&#x2019;ll have to read it to see how these stories link.</p> <p><em>Blind Curve</em>, the book I&#x2019;m working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour. I was pulled out of my car for a minor traffic violation&#x2014;an incident that escalated into my being thrown into cuffs and told I was going to jail. Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.</p> <p>As long as events like these keep happening to me, I&#x2019;ll be in good shape!</p> <p><strong>LG:</strong> Your last novel, <em>Reckless</em>, was a &#x201c;ripped from the headlines&#x201d; sort of novel, whereas <em>Eyes Wide Open</em> draws from events in your life. What prompted you to pull from your personal experiences this time around, and how hard was that to write?</p> <strong> </strong> <p><strong> AG:</strong> It's much, much, much harder to write a story from your own life that affects real people, and some of them people you care for&#x2014;especially those who have suffered tragedy, like me brother. On the other hand, drawing from personal experience makes for a much more enriching and rewarding story, one that is filled with the detail and resonance of real life. I wanted to write a poignant, personal testament to my nephew that was also a thriller, using a theme I seem to carry from book to book&#x2014;a family hiding a secret past; in this case, revolving around teenage suicide, sons fighting against their fathers, the L.A. music scene in the &#x2019;60s, and an encounter with that Manson-like figure. Hopefully what came out is a chilling, rich, autobiographical, and satisfying tale filled with the kind of richness and family lore that you usually find in a memoir. While writing <em>Eyes Wide Open</em> from events in my own life was tough, and awkward&#x2014;and you know you may not please everyone&#x2014;to me, it became more rewarding in the end.</p> <p><strong> LG:</strong> OK, so you mentioned that as a child you had a passing encounter with Charles Manson, which helped inspire <em>Eyes Wide Open</em>. Say what?</p> <p><strong> AG:</strong> Okay. I go back and forth on this. <em>Eyes Wide Open</em> isn't a book about Manson, or even a Manson-like character, though a cultish figure is a chilling detail in the book. My dad moved out to L.A. in the &#x2019;60s and my older brother, a wayward spirit trying to become a musician, was out there as well, and, uh, took up residence on the Spahn Ranch, where Manson lived. At that time, Charlie was also trying to get his music produced. The two of them came up to my father's place one day and tried to sell him on anteing up for a demo. Manson was gaunt, quiet, creepy&#x2014;and yes, he had those dark eyes. Though, at that time, Charlie Manson hadn't become the infamous &#x201c;Charles Manson&#x201d; yet! The scene eventually turned ugly&#x2014;which I describe in the book&#x2014;and they left, humiliated and angry. For years, my dad always insisted that the clan went up into the canyons that night looking to pay him back for what took place, but got lost in the L.A. hills and ended up at Sharon Tate&#x2019;s. Truth was, by that time my brother was long gone and, of course, there were other reasons the Manson clan ended up at Sharon Tate&#x2019;s house. But it makes a chilling scene!</p> <p><strong> LG:</strong> Having followed your novels since <em>The Dark Tide</em>, I&#x2019;ve noticed that you&#x2019;re drawn to stories involving complex family dynamics. What is it about this theme that resonates so strongly for you, and how has your own experience as a father influenced your writing?</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> I don't like writing straight-up thrillers. I like writing about families hurled into crisis and danger&#x2014;soccer moms and regular dads and husbands who might have to rescue their daughters or who are, say, hedge fund managers and have one foot on the sidelines watching their kids and the other in nefarious cover-ups and conspiracies. These are the &#x201c;real life&#x201d; stories that intrigue me and provide the basis for the emotional complexity I&#x2019;m looking for. As for being a dad, it makes you know exactly what you would do&#x2014;basically anything&#x2014;to save your own family. And how creepy and evil one has to be to betray theirs!</p> <p><strong> LG:</strong> One thriller writer to another, what draws you to suspense&#x2014;and what&#x2019;s your favorite thing about thrillers?</p> <p><strong> AG:</strong> You know what, Lisa, you can make a strong case that thriller writing is the single most relevant genre of fiction being written today, because it reflects the conflicts and crises and stories that we read every day in the news and that shape our world. The people who come to our craft aren&#x2019;t just graduate students, or MFA candidates or teachers, but CIA agents and journalists and doctors and lawyers whose experiences in life inform their work. As for suspense, I like to write books that draw you into the hero&#x2019;s plight from the opening pages, where people put their lives on the line for something&#x2014;a belief, a family member, the truth. I&#x2019;m actually more into heroism than evil&#x2014;but it's hard to have one without the other and when their arcs meet and they clash... well, there's suspense!</p> <p><strong> LG:</strong> Without giving too much away, what&#x2019;s your favorite scene in <em>Eyes Wide Open?</em></p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> Well, there are many, because the characters are based on people I know. But without doubt, one of the best involves my everyman hero, Jay Erlich, a doctor from Westchester who puts his successful life on hold and his life on the line to find the truth behind his nephew's suicide. Erlich goes to the super-max Pelican Bay Prison to see the long incarcerated Manson-like murderer, Russell Hovnanian. And the thing that makes that scene really creepy, and made hard to write, was that to be credible, this character, Hovnanian, had to be smarter than my hero, smarter than the very smart detective who accompanies him, even smarter than the reader! Oh yeah, the author too. But when it's pulled off, as I hope I did, it's a killer scene.</p> <p><strong> LG:</strong> You wrote six <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers with James Patterson. Dish. What was it like to work with Jim, and how much more fun is it to control everything yourself?</p> <p><strong> AG:</strong> Such good questions. Are you a writer, too? Oh, wait. Never mind.</p> <p>Ha! Jim and I got along fine; he's an amazing idea guy, his instincts for plot are finely honed, and I think he might even say himself that he's a sharper editor than a writer. I always describe working with him as an MFA and MBA course in thriller management rolled into one. I learned a lot of things about how to craft a thriller that would have taken years to learn on my own&#x2014;and how to put them in my own style. I&#x2019;m honestly proud of the six books we did together, all of which went to number one. But yes, I&#x2019;m kind of a control guy&#x2014;how did you know?</p> <p>To his credit, Jim let me have a substantial share of control on the books we did&#x2014;probably a lot more than I would have. He&#x2019;s a much more evolved manager than me! And all these books later, I still kind of miss him, calling him up, running a plot idea by him. I mean, is there a better person in the world to bounce an idea off of? But I also like it when the checks are made out solely to me!</p> <p><strong>LG:</strong> Now tell me the truth. What is your least favorite part of writing&#x2014;and you can only choose one.</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> Easy&#x2014;this is becoming a bit of a running theme here&#x2014;loss of control! You shape your baby from the initial birth of an idea, live with it daily, watch it grow like a child into a fully dimensional being. You feel you know it better than anybody. Then you turn it over and put it out into the world and between the cover, the marketing, the presentation at retail and the sales, it all takes place without you being able to control its destiny a single lick! And by that time, you're already halfway into the next one anyway!</p> <p><strong> LG:</strong> Finally, what do you want readers to take away from reading <em>Eyes Wide Open</em>&#x2014;and congrats on another great novel!</p> <p><strong>AG:</strong> Thanks, Lisa. What I would have them take away is that <em>Eyes Wide Open</em> is not only a thrilling read, it's also an engrossing, emotional family story&#x2014;about a family with a dark history and the lengths it will go to protect that secret. It&#x2019;s also about two brothers, one wayward, the other successful, and how they try to bridge the gap that tore them apart. It reads like a personal memoir chock-full of thrills. And it&#x2019;s my family story.</p> <p>So great to be with you today! I was a big fan of <em>Love You More</em>. It&#x2019;s been a lot of fun!</p><p>Jay Erlich's nephew has been found at the bottom of a cliff at Morrow Bay&#x2014;a tragic suicide, it appears, until secrets from the past rear up again. </p><p>Years ago, Jay's older brother, Charlie, a wayward child of the sixties, fell under the sway of a charismatic but deeply disturbed cult leader in California&#x2014;a mesmerizing human monster who set a nightmare of violence into motion.

The Hugo Award-winning Foglios (Girl Genius) present the first three volumes of their popular gaslight fantasy comic in novelized form, maintaining the zany energy, witty repartee, creative characterization, and innovative world-building of the original. Agatha Clay is a university lab assistant in a world filled with madboy scientists, dangerous automata, and not quite human soldiers with silly Germanic accents. She soon finds herself a pawn in political power struggles when her locket is stolen and she is taken hostage on the airship of the powerful Baron Klaus Wulfenbach. While trying to stay alive long enough to discover the truth, she begins to discover her personal history and genius talents of her own. This version keeps closely to the original plot, and uses most of the original dialogue, but also provides expanded scenes and character interiority that will delight regular fans of the series. Although this book is likely not the best way to experience the Foglios' talent for the first time, and cannot do justice to the sheer buxomness of its main character, it is entirely comprehensible and enjoyable on its own without its comic counterparts.

Soon two other young women are found killed in the same unusual way. Siri learns that all three victims studied in Europe and that one of them was being pursued by a mysterious stalker. But before he can solve the case, he is whisked away to Cambodia on a diplomatic mission. Though on the surface the Khmer Rouge seem to be committed to the socialist cause, Siri soon learns the horrifying truth of the killing fields and finds himself thrown into prison.

SIRI<br><br>I celebrate the dawn of my seventy-fourth birthday handcuffed<br>to a lead pipe. I&#x2019;d had something more traditional<br>in mind: a few drinks with my new wife, some gay <i>molum</i><br>music on the record player, shellfish plucked fresh from<br>the Mekhong. But <i>here</i> I am in Hades and not a balloon in<br>sight. My ex-roommate, a gray-faced youth in his early twenties,<br>is chained by the ankle to the far end of the same pipe.<br>They dragged the boy in during the night and we struggled<br>to communicate. We scratched for words to share. But as<br>soon as he understood that we were different animals in<br>the same abattoir, tears of despair carved uneven grooves<br>down his bloody cheeks. I could do nothing but sit back<br>against the flaking plaster and watch the life drain from<br>him. He didn&#x2019;t live to greet the new day. When the sun<br>finally sneered through the wire mesh of the window, it<br>cast a shadow like a fisherman&#x2019;s net across the body. The<br>corpse lay trapped, expired from the effort of untangling<br>itself from all this unnecessary misery. But his soul was free.<br>I envied him that.<br><br>I am Dr. Siri Paiboun, the national and only coroner of<br>the People&#x2019;s Democratic Republic of Laos, a medical man, a<br>humanitarian, but I&#x2019;m still unable to summon an appropriate<br>emotion. I listened through the night to the sobs and screams<br>of my unseen neighbors. I didn&#x2019;t understand the words they<br>cried but I knew people were being killed all around me. I<br>scented their essence and saw their fleeing spirits. I am well<br>aware that I will soon be joining them. Yet the overriding<br>thought in my mind is that I didn&#x2019;t have the foresight to<br>say goodbye or thank you to the people I love. That sounds<br>corny, I know, but what&#x2019;s wrong with corny? It has its place.<br><br>I wonder whether they might know instinctively. Really. I<br>wonder whether they&#x2019;ve been able to see through this crusty,<br>annoyingly stubborn exterior to the warm and fluffy Siri that<br>nestles barely visible inside me. If only I could squeeze the hand<br>of Madame Daeng one final time, ruffle the newly permed hair<br>of Mr. Geung, sniff the cheeks of Nurse Dtui and her milkscented<br>baby, and slap Inspector Phosy on the back. If only I<br>could raise one last glass with my best friend, Civilai. But those<br>opportunities will never come. The amulet that protected<br>me from the malevolent spirits was ripped from my neck,<br>stolen by one of the teenaged guards. I am exposed. Once<br>the ghosts are aware their enemy is unprotected, they will<br>circle me like hungry jungle dogs and close in for the kill.<br>All things considered, at this almost final analysis, I am<br>stuffed.<br><br>&nbsp;***<br><br>The woman read from the carbon copy in front of her. The<br>sheet was of such proportions as to defy filing and of such<br>poor quality that it was almost inevitable the words would<br>be sucked back into the fibers like invisible ink returning<br>whence it had emerged. The clerk had a pleasant voice,<br>soothing like honey balm, and the two old men opposite<br>stared at her luscious lips as she spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, it isn&#x2019;t finalized,&#x201d; she smiled. &#x201c;But it will certainly<br>read something like this.&#x201d; She coughed. &#x201c;The People&#x2019;s<br>Democratic Republic of Laos would have it known<br>that Dr. Siri Paiboun, national coroner, hero of the Revolution<br>and lifetime member of the Communist Party, passed<br>away on the second of May 1978. Dr. Siri had fought tirelessly<br>and fearlessly for the Revolution and was&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fearlessly first,&#x201d; one of the men interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would be better to have &#x2018;fearlessly&#x2019; before &#x2018;tirelessly,&#x2019;<br>then nobody would be in doubt as to whether he&#x2019;d been<br>tired out by the lack of fearing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; the second man agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;What? Hmm. I&#x2019;m not sure I understand that.&#x201d; But the<br>girl conceded the point and made a note on the pad beside<br>her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll mention it to Comrade Sisavee. It is only the first<br>draft but, to tell the truth, we called you in to check on the<br>factual, rather than the syntactical elements of the eulogy.<br>We have people to deal with all the technicalities in later<br>versions. I&#x2019;ll read on if I m&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And &#x2018;was struck down dead&#x2019; has a more heroic ring to<br>it,&#x201d; the second old man said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s factual.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Struck down?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rather than &#x2018;passed away,&#x2019;&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;&#x2018;Passed away&#x2019;<br>makes it sound like bodily wind, a collection of stomach<br>gases on their way out. Do you know what I mean? We&#x2019;re<br>talking about heroism here. Heroes don&#x2019;t just &#x2018;pass&#x2019; like<br>flatulence in a strong breeze.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With or without scent,&#x201d; added the first man most<br>seriously.<br><br>The clerk glared from one old gentleman to the next,<br>then back to the first.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you playing with me?&#x201d; she asked sternly.<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly not, sweet young lady,&#x201d; said the skinnier of the<br>two men. He was bald as a bowling ball with a long camellike<br>throat sporting an Adam&#x2019;s apple so large it might well<br>have been Adam&#x2019;s original. &#x201c;This is a most serious affair.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No laughing matter,&#x201d; agreed the first.<br><br>Still uncertain of her ground, the young lady pressed<br>on. &#x201c;The nation will never forget the contribution Dr. Siri<br>made to the development of this great nation, nor<br>can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s two nations,&#x201d; said the bald man.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, do let her finish,&#x201d; said the other. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t she tell<br>you they have a department that handles syntax? Probably<br>an entire ministry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Ministry of Getting Words Right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or it could be a branch of the Ministry of Making<br>Things Up and Bamboozling People.&#x201d;<br><br>The clerk was miffed. She slapped the paper onto the<br>wooden table top and drummed her fingers on it noisily.<br>She seemed to be wrestling down a darker inner person. Her<br>voluptuous mouth had become mysteriously unattractive.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think either of you appreciate what a great<br>honor this is,&#x201d; she said at last. Her eyes watered. &#x201c;Anybody<br>else would be proud. Dr. Siri, I&#x2019;m particularly disappointed<br>that you would take all this so lightly. Given your record, it&#x2019;s<br>a wonder your name is on the list at all.&#x201d;<br><br>Siri raised the thickets of coarse white hair he called<br>eyebrows and scratched at his missing left earlobe.<br><br>&#x201c;To be fair, you&#x2019;re not giving me much time,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;How can I take life seriously when I&#x2019;m forced to squeeze<br>all those remaining pleasures into a mere twelve days? And<br>look at this. You&#x2019;re passing me away on my birthday of all<br>occasions. The happiest day of the year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s odd, Doctor,&#x201d; she said through clenched teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I had explained myself very clearly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell him again,&#x201d; said ex-politburo member Civilai. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s<br>elderly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As I said,&#x201d; she began slowly, &#x201c;the actual date of your<br>death will be filled in later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the event of it?&#x201d; Siri said.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you aren&#x2019;t actually expecting me to . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>The transparent northeastern skin of her neck revealed<br>an atlas of purple roads heading north in the direction of<br>her cheeks. The men admired her composure as she took<br>a deep breath and continued.<br><br>&#x201c;You will pass away naturally, or otherwise, as your destiny<br>dictates. At that stage we will delete your date of birth<br>and substitute it with your date of death. When that happens<br>we will issue the announcement. Is that clear now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I will become a hero,&#x201d; Siri smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;It probably won&#x2019;t be instantaneous . . . in your case.&#x201d;<br><br>The Department of Hero Creation, the DHC, was housed<br>in a small annex of the propaganda section of the Ministry<br>of Information. Based loosely on a Vietnamese initiative<br>already in place, the DHC was responsible for identifying<br>role models, exaggerating their revolutionary qualities, and<br>creating a fairy story around their lives. A week earlier, Dr.<br>Siri and Comrade Civilai had received their invitations to<br>attend this preliminary meeting. They&#x2019;d heard of the DHC,<br>of course, and seen evidence of its devious work. Everyone<br>over seventy who&#x2019;d done the Party the great service of<br>staying alive was under consideration. If selected, school<br>textbooks would mention their bravery. Histories would<br>be written detailing their supernatural ability to surmount<br>the insurmountable and carry the red flag to victory. Siri<br>and Civilai could hardly pass up a chance to scuttle such a<br>nefarious scheme.<br><br>&#x201c;What is my case?&#x201d; Siri asked.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You said, &#x2018;In your case,&#x2019; suggesting I have some flaw.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t hold back,&#x201d; Civilai urged the clerk.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really not my place to . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; Civilai prodded. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t tell anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>She seemed pleased to do so.<br><br>&#x201c;We are aware of the doctor&#x2019;s . . . problems with authority,&#x201d;<br>the clerk said. She was now ignoring Siri and talking<br>directly with Civilai. &#x201c;But history has a short memory. It has<br>a way of smudging over personality flaws no matter how<br>serious they might be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Voltaire said that history is just the portrayal of crimes<br>and misfortunes,&#x201d; Siri said.<br><br>&#x201c;And why should I care what a wealthy eighteenth century<br>snob aristocrat has to say about anything?&#x201d; she<br>snapped. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have thoughts of your own, Doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>Siri smiled at Civilai, who raised his eyebrows in return.<br>The old friends were constantly on the lookout for fire,<br>intelligence, and passion within the system and, when<br>found, it brought out their untapped paternal instincts.<br>Most cadres wouldn&#x2019;t have known Voltaire from a bag of<br>beans. Their early-evening visit to the Ministry of Information<br>had not been a waste of time after all.<br><br>Following a politburo decree, the words <i>Minister</i> and<br><i>Ministry</i> had been liberated from the dungeon of antisocialist<br>political rhetoric and new ministries had mushroomed.<br>There was infighting within each ministry as each department<br>and section vied for its own ministerial status. Everyone<br>wanted to be a minister. The secretarial pool at the<br>new Ministry of Justice had put in an application to become<br>the Ministry of Typing and head clerk Manivone had put<br>her name down to become the minister of Changing Ink<br>Ribbons. Dr. Siri had helped her with the paperwork and<br>it had taken several bottles of rice whisky to get it right. Of<br>course, they hadn&#x2019;t submitted the form. The system didn&#x2019;t<br>have a sense of humor.<br><br>There was nothing inherently funny about the People&#x2019;s<br>Democratic Republic of Laos in the 1970s. The socialists<br>had taken over the country three years earlier but the fun of<br>having a whole country to play with had soon drained away.<br>Euphoria had been replaced by paranoia, and anyone who<br>didn&#x2019;t take the Republic seriously was considered a threat.<br>Dissidents were still being sent to &#x201c;seminars&#x201d; in the northeast<br>to join the ranks of officials from the old regime who<br>were learning to grit their teeth and say, &#x201c;Yes, Comrade.&#x201d;<br><br>But Siri and Civilai, forty-year veterans of the struggle, were<br>tolerated. They posed no threat to the status quo and their<br>rants against the system could be dismissed&#x2014;with sarcastic<br>laughter&#x2014;as senile gibberish. But there was nothing senile<br>or gibberitic about these two old Comrades. Their minds<br>sparkled like a March night sky. Given a chance, they could<br>outstrategize any man or woman on the Central Committee.<br>To find a young crocodile with a good mind among<br>that flock of flamingos was a rare delight.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re quite right, of course.&#x201d; Siri bowed his head to<br>the clerk. &#x201c;Forgive me. I&#x2019;m prone, like many men my age,<br>to presuppose that young people have no minds. I assume<br>they all will be impressed with my bourgeois philosophy.<br>You are obviously a cut above the rest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you aren&#x2019;t going to win me over with your flattery<br>either,&#x201d; she added.<br><br>&#x201c;Or with pink mimosa or sugared dates, no doubt,&#x201d; Siri<br>added. He thought he noticed a germ of a smile on her<br>lips. &#x201c;You really have to see the funny side of all this, you<br>know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is that?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You really want me to tell you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m tempted to suggest you fabricate people&#x2019;s<br>experiences here. I noticed, for example, that your DHC<br>has Comrade Bounmee Laoly charging into battle armed<br>with only a machete at the age of sixty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lot of people are still very active at sixty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know that, but I also happen to know from personal<br>experience he was already blind as a bat when he turned<br>fifty. He couldn&#x2019;t find a machete, let alone brandish one.&#x201d;<br><br>She blushed, &#x201c;I . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All we ask,&#x201d; Civilai took over, &#x201c;is, should this great honor<br>of herohood befall us&#x2014;hopefully not posthumously&#x2014;that<br>we earn it from merit, not with the aid of major reconstructive<br>surgery from Information.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d like people to remember and respect us for what<br>we are,&#x201d; Siri said.<br><br>&#x201c;Warts and all,&#x201d; Civilai added.<br><br>Siri and Civilai sloshed and slithered hand in hand through<br>the rain to the ministry car park. A cream Citroen with a<br>missing taillight and a sturdy Triumph motorcycle were the<br>only two vehicles there. They were parked in muddy water<br>like boats. Drowning grass poked here and there through<br>the brown gravy.<br><br>&#x201c;Smart lady,&#x201d; Siri said.<br><br>&#x201c;She certainly put us in our places.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nice lips.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exceptional.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They did remain clenched when you asked about your<br>warts, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They did.&#x201d;<br><br>Civilai opened the unlocked door of his old car and sat<br>behind the steering wheel. Siri climbed into the passenger<br>seat. They sat for a moment staring at the unpainted side<br>wall of the building. As the concrete absorbed the endless<br>rains, Siri fancied he saw the outline of New Zealand stained<br>there, or it could have been the silhouette of a twisted balloon<br>poodle. Following a disastrous year of drought, the<br>farmers had smiled to see the early arrival of the 1978 rains.<br>It was as if the gods had awakened late and, realizing their<br>negligence, had hastily attempted to make up for the previous<br>year. The rain fell heavily and ceaselessly&#x2014;three times<br>the national average for April. The Lao New Year water<br>festival celebrations&#x2014;a time to call down the first rains of<br>the year&#x2014;were rained out. The earthen embankments of<br>the new rice paddies were washed flat; the bougainvilleas<br>had been rinsed colorless. The earth seemed to cry, &#x201c;All<br>right. Enough.&#x201d; But still it rained. It was nature&#x2019;s little joke.<br>Like the Eskimos with their four million words for snow,<br>the Lao vocabulary was expanding with new language to<br>describe rain.<br><br>Today the water hung in the air like torn strips of gray<br>paper.<br><br>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Civilai asked.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That noise you&#x2019;re making.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a noise. It&#x2019;s a song. I have no idea where I heard<br>it. I can&#x2019;t get it out of my head.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well try. It&#x2019;s annoying.&#x201d;<br><br>Siri swallowed his song.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think they&#x2019;ve got on me?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;I<br>mean, the DHC.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Civilai laughed. &#x201c;I knew it. You do want to be a<br>national hero.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not.

He meets Polish artists nostalgic for their revolutionary days, Mongolian neo-Nazis in full SS regalia, and a gay expat in Ulaanbaatar who needs an armed escort between his home and his job. The Russian punk scene is thrust onto the international stage with the furor surrounding the arrest of the group Pussy Riot, and Ukrainians find themselves in the midst of a revolution and then a full-blown war.&gt; <br> <br>While engaging with the works of literary predecessors from Rebecca West to Chekhov and the nineteenth-century French aristocrat the Marquis de Custine, Nicolay explores the past and future of punk rock culture in the postcommunist world in the kind of book a punk rock Paul Theroux might have written, with a humor reminiscent of Gary Shteyngart. An audacious debut from a vivid new voice, <i>The Humorless Ladies of Border Control</i> is an unforgettable, funny, and sharply drawn depiction of surprisingly robust hidden spaces tucked within faraway lands.</p><p><b>Franz Nicolay</b> is a New York musician who has played with myriad acts including the Hold Steady, Against Me!, and the Dresden Dolls and was a founding member of the composer/performer collective Anti-Social Music.<i>Dying Scene</i> recently named him #1 of Punk&#x2019;s 10 Best Accordion Players.&#x201d; He teaches at Bard College and this is his first book.<b>Praise for <i>The Humorless Ladies of Border Control</i>:</b> <br> A pleasing romp: punk in attitude but literary in execution and a fine work of armchair travel for those unwilling to strap on an accordion on the streets of Rostov for themselves.&#x201d;<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br> <br></p><h2>Death and Restoration (Art History Mystery)</h2><p>General Bottando can&#39;t believe his rotten luck. He has just been promoted--to a position that&#39;s heavy on bureaucratic duties-but disturbingly light on investigative responsibilities. As if that wasn&#39;t annoying enough, he&#39;s received a tip about a planned raid at a nearby monastery. He&#39;s relying on his colleague Flavia di Stefano and her art-expert fianc�, Jonathan Argyll, to thwart the plot-but both are beyond baffled. The only valuable item in the monastery&#39;s art collection is a supposed Caravaggio that&#39;s currently being restored. There are no solid suspects-unless you count the endearing art thief, the flagrantly flamboyant &#34;Rottweiler of Restoration,&#34; and the strangely shady icon expert. And there&#39;s really no reason to cause an unholy uproar-until someone commits an unconscionable crime...</p><p>Like <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>, Iain Pears's <i>Death and Restoration</i> is grounded in a richly cultured vision rife with references to European history, art, and cuisine. And, though it represents the sixth novel in Pears's Jonathan Argyll series, the author subtly informs new readers of the key relationships and the past histories of his characters within the first three chapters. Once again, Argyll and his soon-to-be wife, Flavia di Stefano, are enmeshed in the Italian art world: Flavia, as a member of the Rome police's art squad and Argyll as a professor of art history. <p> The suspense of the novel is sustained by the careful revelation of the central art-theft plot; in turn, each major character becomes the narrative center and offers an expanded understanding of the events at San Giovanni. While Argyll is troubled over his fianc�e's frequent absences just prior to their wedding, Flavia feels compelled to keep odd hours. She's certain that her old nemesis, Mary Verney, has returned to Rome with the intention of committing a major new theft. And Verney, readers soon learn, is herself in jeopardy. She <i>must</i> steal a Madonna icon from the monastery--despite the close scrutiny she faces from the Rome police force--because the sadistic Mikis Charanis has kidnapped Verney's granddaughter, 8-year-old Louise, and he will only release the child when Verney has acquired the artifact from San Giovanni. Underlying each character's concerns is the mystery of the Madonna itself. Why does Charanis covet this piece over the more valuable, though still dubious, Caravaggio that is also in the monastery? In the end, the novel is a perfect melding of a tightly composed mystery plot, witty dialogue, and a realistic sense of character, all flowing from an intellectual's appreciation for the finer things in life. For readers who discovered Pears's fiction through <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>, the Argyll series--particularly <i>Death and Restoration</i>--offers much to satiate the need for his pleasantly baroque sensibilities. Other works in the Argyll series include <i>The Raphael Affair</i>, <i>The Titian Committee</i>, <i>The Bernini Bust</i>, <i>The Last Judgement</i>, and <i>Giotto's Hand</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Iain Pears was born in 1955.

In an age when prepackaged gospel formulations leave people cold, well-told Bible stories can be used powerfully by God to touch people's hearts and draw them to himself. After ministry in both Western and non-Western contexts, church planter Christine Dillon has discovered that Bible storying is far more effective than most other forms of apologetics or evangelistic presentations. In fact, non-Christians actually enjoyed storying and kept coming back for more. Storying provides solid biblical foundations so listeners can understand, apply and respond to the gospel, and then go on to fruitful maturity in God's service. This book includes practical guidance on how to shape a good story, how to do evangelism through storying and how to lead Bible discussions. With particular insights for trainers and those working in crosscultural contexts, this guide provides you with concrete steps for sharing the Story that everyone needs to hear.</p><p><strong>Christine Dillon</strong> is an OMF missionary from Australia, now serving as a church planter in Taiwan. She is the author of <em>1-2-1 Discipleship: Helping One Another Grow Spiritually.</em>"Dillon's easy-to-implement instruction is a helpful resource for the reader wanting to experience the power of story. Her work offers the storying movement and the church a valuable medium to communicate with." (Mark W. Overstreet, Evangelical Missions Quarterly, April 2013)<br><br>"This wonderful 'how to' book is not merely a brief introduction to storytelling, but is an in-depth biblical and practical study of this important subject. Regardless of your present approach to evangelism, you will find this book to be a significant help as you have the opportunity to introduce others to Jesus Christ." (Paul Cedar, Outreach Magazine, "Resources of the Year" issue, March/April 2013)<br><br>"This is a must-read for the beginner, as well as those already involved in storytelling as a way of sharing the gospel. I highly recommend it." (Skip Holman, Baptist Standard, November 19, 2012)<br><br>"<em>Telling the Gospel Through Story</em> provides a fresh approach to all who take evangelism seriously and seek proficiency at making Christ known." (Jerry Root, Christianity Today, July/August 2012)<br><br>"There are many subjects that can be discussed and understood at primarily an academic level. Orality is not one of them. Christine Dillon understands this distinction and has treated the topic of storying in a practical and hands-on fashion in <em>Telling the Gospel Through Story</em>. Her journey into orality has been bumpy, like my own, and has been hammered out through years of both firsthand experience and hosting training seminars in numerous contexts. One sentence in the book sums up her overall philosophy: 'Nothing beats hearing the stories being told in a real situation.' I appreciate her willingness to glean from other practitioners and even to plug the approach that has most resonated with me personally--Simply The Story. If you find that the exegetical tool in your communication tool belt is like Thor's hammer, but your narrative communication is more like a pair of tweezers, then this is the book for you." (Dr. Larry Dinkins, Th.M., Ph.D., OMF International missionary to Thailand for 32 years)<br><br>"Christine has given us a most welcome introduction and primer in her book <em>Telling the Gospel Through Story</em>. While her context is crosscultural, she makes a strong case for pastors and evangelists everywhere to understand the importance of, and the ways and means to share, biblical narratives. This book will be helpful in all gospel preaching and homiletics in general." (Lon Allison, executive director, Billy Graham Center, Wheaton College)<br><br>"We live by stories. Family stories. Celebrities' stories. Historical stories. Something happens. And then--? We stop to listen. We can't help it. The story pulls us in. Much of God's revelation is story. People act, but even before that, God acts. Christine Dillon knows the power of God's never-ending story. In this book she shows us how to tell it so as to transmit truth that will transform the listeners." (Miriam Adeney, author of Kingdom Without Borders: The Untold Story of Global Christianity)<br><br>"This is an excellent book that I would encourage all serious Christians to read. Using moving stories, Christine shares insights she has learned about telling (gospel) stories effectively. She answers the questions that will come to the reader's mind. Christine is honest that this method will not cause all to come to Christ, but the method may have the best chance of people hearing the whole story and wanting more. I will be recommending this book for all our workers, both new and experienced." (Richard Schlitt, deputy general director, OMF)<br><br>"Human beings make sense of our lives through stories. Yet all too often when it comes to evangelism, Christians offer some abstract theological propositions for people to agree with or not, rather than inviting them to enter the Story the Bible is narrating. Christine Dillon calls us to recapture the beauty, power and mystery of storying the gospel, and does so with the wisdom of a practitioner." (Sean Gladding, author of The Story of God, the Story of Us)<br><br>"I appreciate Christine Dillon's knowledge and experience of using storytelling in evangelism. Many people love to talk about 'orality' and theorize on how and why it should work. Christine learned the concepts of storytelling and immediately started using them. Over the years, she has had to improve her skills, change her approach and develop her methods. This ongoing process has been key in her success. Now she has written down what she has learned. This is a must-read for those wanting to develop these same skills."

He then received a Masters of Arts degree from Central Michigan University and did 45 more hours of graduate work in English at Eastern Michigan University and Michigan State University. Dave retired after 30 years of teaching writing in college, high school, junior high and grade school. <p> When their son was in the fourth grade, Dave and his wife Lea realized that he was not being given the training they felt he needed and elected to homeschool him in language arts. To prepare him for college writing, they designed a series of lessons, which he completed by the age of twelve. That summer, they enrolled him in freshman English at Lake Michigan College, where he received his first A in college work. He is now a poet and university professor. </p><p> Dave and Lea later turned these lessons into the Writing Strands series of books. While Dave never maintained that the series could create poets for other homeschooling parents, he felt that if children worked successfully through the Writing Strands series of books, they would have the skills needed for the challenge of any writing assignment in their undergraduate college work.</p></p><h2>The Passion from Within</h2><p><p></p><p>The mystic Adrienne von Speyr, drawing on her very special God-given charism of being able to experience the interior states of persons, shares her profound insights on the suffering, loneliness and loss Christ endured for love of us during His Passion. These unique experiences and insights of von Speyr on Christ's redemptive sufferings, and the people and events surrounding Him, offer rich and moving material for meditation and adoration. She also presents rare and beautiful mediations on Christ's mysterious presence in the Eucharist, as well as a kind of "theology of the body", echoing John Paul II's emphasis on the dignity and importance of the human body in our relationship to God.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Adrienne von Speyr</b>&nbsp;(1902&#x2013;1967) was a Swiss medical doctor, a convert to Catholicism, a mystic, and an author of more than sixty books on spirituality and theology.

Years later&#x2014;one struggling with his identity in a world hostile to his ancestry, the other creating the world&#x2019;s most famous detective while in love with a woman who is not his wife&#x2013;their fates become inextricably connected.In <i>Arthur &amp; George</i>, Julian Barnes explores the grand tapestry of late-Victorian Britain to create his most intriguing and engrossing novel yet.</p><p>A real <i>tour de force</i> from masterful author Julian Barnes is <i>Arthur &amp; George</i>, which was short-listed for the 2005 Man Booker Prize. Late-Victorian Britain is brought to vivid life in the true story of the intersection of two lives: one an internationally famous author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the other, an obscure country lawyer, George Edalji, son of a Parsi Midlands vicar and a Scottish mother. They start out very differently. Arthur pursues a career in medicine before he discovers that he is really a writer; George, on his way to becoming a lawyer--near-sighted, timid and friendless--is victimized by locals because he is easy to scapegoat--a half-Indian in lily-white Great Wyrley. <p> The victimization of George takes the form of nasty letters, the theft of a school key, and finally, the accusation that he has mutilated animals. Meanwhile, Arthur is becoming more and more famous for creating Sherlock Holmes, whom he tries to kill off once and is forced to resurrect because of his fans' outcry. He marries, fathers two children and then, when his wife is invalided by consumption, falls madly in love for the first time with Jean Leckie. </p><p> The novel's style is smoothly revelatory. We slowly come to realize that George is half-Indian, that Arthur is the famous Doyle, that the woman he loves, chastely, is not his wife and, sadly, that George will not prevail over the forces ranged against him. </p><p> When George, desperate to resume his law career after imprisonment, sends Arthur the sad chronicle of his history, Arthur sees immediately that he could not be guilty and sets out to clear his name. This case of George's lifts Arthur from the slough of despond into which he has sunk after his wife, Touie, dies. He is guilt-ridden, constantly wondering if he was attentive enough, if she could possibly have known about Jean. Realizing the immense injustice George has suffered, he is shaken out of lethargy and, in Holmesian fashion, sets out to solve the case. </p><p> Julian Barnes is a gifted writer of enormous accomplishment. This novel is thoroughly engrossing, filled with Barnes's trademark themes of identity and love, longing and loss, and ultimately, an examination of man's inhumanity to man. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Julian Barnes is the author of two books of stories, two collections of essays, a translation of Alphonse Daudet's <i>In the Land of Pain</i>, and nine previous novels.

The intruder&#x2019;s lantern cast fantastic shadows. Hardie wore civilian clothes and crouched under the tent&#x2019;s slant. It took Meade a moment to recognize him.<br>&#x201c;What the devil?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to give you trouble,&#x201d; the colonel said.<br>Blades of alarm pierced weariness. Meade sat up sharply.<br>&#x201c;My conscience is clear,&#x201d; he declared.<br>Margaret had warned him to check his temper. Now Hooker had charged him with insubordination, with Halleck&#x2019;s acquiescence and bespectacled Hardie as henchman. He was being relieved of his command, arrested in the middle of a campaign. There would be a court-martial. Reputation&#x2019;s assassin sneaking into camp, this colonel from the adjutant general&#x2019;s office had come in the dark, in disguise. And he had always thought Hardie a decent fellow.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done&nbsp;... nothing dishonorable,&#x201d; Meade protested. &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d; He yearned for coffee just off the fire, for the light of day, for a friend. &#x201c;My differences with General Hooker&nbsp;... have been matters of professional judgment, nothing more.&#x201d;<br>The colonel raised a hand to quiet him. The gesture struck Meade as insolent. Hardie grinned.<br>Black and devilish, flies looped around the lantern the colonel held. Settling the light on the camp desk, Hardie drew a pair of envelopes from a pocket.<br>&#x201c;General Meade, you are ordered to assume command of the Army of the Potomac. Effective immediately, sir. I&#x2019;m to accompany you to General Hooker&#x2019;s headquarters, to witness the transfer of authority.&#x201d;<br>Dumbfounded, Meade took the documents. He didn&#x2019;t open them, but held the papers atop one knee. He wondered if arrest would not have been preferable. He began to wake fully and bitterly.<br>Outside, the camp clattered, despite the wretched hour. A sergeant barked and soldiers answered. Chains chimed and horses whinnied. Hardie&#x2019;s arrival had yanked them all from sleep. His staff officers would be gathering by his tent, waiting to hear the news that had come from Washington.<br>How much had they guessed? Meade needed coffee. Coffee and John Reynolds. Reynolds was the man for this. Men followed him and loved him. Handsome John. He was the man to take command of the army. How foolish he himself had been to resent Reynolds&#x2019; advancement. He rued his pettiness now.<br>Meade sighed. He meant to rise and put on his uniform coat, to wrap his old bones in a guise of authority. But the flesh hesitated.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not qualified,&#x201d; he told Hardie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the devil&#x2019;s choice for this. I mustn&#x2019;t command this army.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the president&#x2019;s decision.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about Reynolds? Is it true he turned it down?&#x201d;<br>Hardie shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe there was a formal offer. Anyway, the president chose you, sir. General Halleck and Mr. Stanton concurred. They sent me to Frederick by special train. There&#x2019;s no time to lose.&#x201d;<br>Meade snapped, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I understand that?&#x201d;<br><i>Halleck.</i> The man was devoured by jealousy. Of Reynolds, that much was evident. Of Reynolds and so many others. Apparently, though, he wasn&#x2019;t jealous of everyone. What does that say of me? Meade asked himself.<br>He did his best to button up his temper. His wife had warned him, more than once, that his tongue cut worse than his sword.<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the seniority on the Army rolls,&#x201d; Meade insisted. Then he added, &#x201c;I thought things had been patched up with General Hooker?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Lincoln lost faith in him.&#x201d;<br>So has the rest of this blasted army, Meade thought. Yet, removing Hooker now was madness. With battle looming. On a field yet unknown.<br>&#x201c;Hardie, I don&#x2019;t want this,&#x201d; he said in a tamed voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the man for this.&#x201d;<br>His visitor gestured toward the envelopes, which remained unopened. Meade unfolded the fateful order, bending to make out the words. Hardie took up the lantern again and brought it closer.<br>It was true. He had been selected as the latest general half-expected to fail and be damned forever.<br><i>Expected</i> to fail? Was that the nub of it?<br>Meade tested each word of the order, then studied the accompanying correspondence from the general-in-chief. &#x201c;Considering the circumstances,&#x201d; Meade read, &#x201c;no one has ever received a more important command.&#x201d;<br>A sharp-fanged creature slithered through his bowels.<br>Had it come to this? With the Confederates already marching on Philadelphia, for all he knew? For all anyone knew? The evening before, he had worn himself out riding through the Maryland countryside trying to find Hooker, the man who held the string and hid both ends. The raw, hot roads had been burdened with batteries and commissary wagons, with regiments coming late to their camps and with stragglers, some of them drunk. No one knew where the army&#x2019;s commander could be found.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want this,&#x201d; Meade said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible. I shall send a message to Halleck.&#x201d;<br>Fixing his spectacles higher on his nose, Hardie said, &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t do any good, sir. The president&#x2019;s mind is made up.&#x201d; He set the lantern back down on the desk.<br>Meade arched his back. The camp bed creaked. &#x201c;Does General Hooker know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He sent in a letter of resignation.&#x201d; A quarter-smile cut into Hardie&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure he meant it to be accepted. But it was.&#x201d; The smile turned cruel enough to tell Meade that Hooker had earned Hardie&#x2019;s enmity. &#x201c;I suspect he&#x2019;ll know by the time we reach army headquarters.&#x201d;<br>Meade snorted. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know where that is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll guide you there, if you&#x2019;ll loan me a horse. I came in a rented buggy.&#x201d;<br>Irritated anew that he had failed to find Hooker&#x2019;s camp the evening before, Meade asked, &#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re so well-informed, Hardie, would you happen to know where General Lee and his army are strolling just now? No one else seems to have any blasted idea. Certainly not this army&#x2019;s corps commanders.&#x201d;<br>The colonel shook his head. &#x201c;General Hooker&#x2019;s communications with Washington have been&nbsp;... limited.&#x201d; Posture deformed by the slope of the canvas, he shed another layer of formality. &#x201c;To tell you the truth, sir, he hasn&#x2019;t told us much of anything. He wouldn&#x2019;t even share his plan of campaign with Mr. Lincoln. All we heard from old Fighting Joe were calls for reinforcements and wails that the army&#x2019;s outnumbered. He sounded more and more like Little Mac. It set the president out of temper. And that&#x2019;s putting it soft.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hardie, do you know where the corps of <i>this</i> army are right now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not all of them. It took some work to find you.&#x201d;<br>The situation reminded Meade of a game he had seen blindfolded children play in Tampico. Spun round, they lashed out with a stick, trying to shatter a dangling plaster animal filled with treats. Except that there would be no treats this time. Only the blind lashing out.<br>Meade reached for his watch. Instead of metal, his hand met the sweat-heavy cloth of an undergarment. <i>Wake up,</i> he commanded himself. <i>Take hold of yourself.</i> &#x201c;What time is it, Hardie?&#x201d;<br>The colonel drew out his watch and clicked open the cover. &#x201c;Half past three, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll have a ride before us. If we must go through with this.&#x201d; He cleared his throat, tasting bile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a few moments alone. And you&#x2019;ll want your breakfast.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; The colonel turned to go.<br>&#x201c;Hardie?&#x201d;<br>Hand on the tent&#x2019;s flap, the visitor turned again. Reflections of the lantern&#x2019;s flame flickered on his spectacles.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been tried and condemned without a hearing, and I suppose I shall have to go to execution,&#x201d; Meade said. He attempted a smile and failed. &#x201c;Send Captain Meade to me. And tell my staff I&#x2019;ll join them shortly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shall I let them know, sir? About the order?&#x201d;<br>Meade brushed a fly from his beard. &#x201c;Do as you see fit.&#x201d;<br>Left alone, Meade clutched the paper that damned him. His bowels winced again. The flesh always reminded a man of the constraints on human dignity.<br>In those last private moments, he thought about young George. It had wounded Meade when the boy was cast from West Point for his follies. Now he himself had been pointed toward failure, toward a far greater failure, a failure that would resound for generations. Was it a curse on the family? His father, too, had failed, in a different way, in a different world.<br>Still waking to the charge that had been given him, Meade felt a wave of shame, as if one of those Barnegat rip currents had changed the direction of an inner sea. He needed to control himself, if he hoped to control the army. To put up a manly show. How could he have indulged in such fretting in front of Hardie? How could he have shown such weakness? Weariness was no excuse, nor was confusion.<br>He imagined the colonel telling tales at the bar in Willard&#x2019;s Hotel. He could hear the laughter of clerks and politicians.<br>Well, the thing was done.<br>In the sour air of his tent, Meade viewed himself with an engineer&#x2019;s cold eye: too dark of thought, too dour, a man alert to the smell of sulfur, but not to Heaven&#x2019;s scent. He could hear Margaret teasing, &#x201c;George, I know you can smile!&#x201d; His wife was a proud, loyal woman, of good family. She had got him a brigadier&#x2019;s rank at the start of the war, when his merits had not sufficed. He would have to do his best for her. And for the Union, of course.<br>Major General George Gordon Meade ha...</p><h2>Rickenbacker Electric 12-String: The Story of the Guitars, the Music, and the Great Players</h2><p>The definitive history of the world's most famous 12-string electric guitar.<br><br>When the Byrds recorded their hit version of Dylan's &#x201c;Mr. Tambourine Man &#x201d; they popularized a new sound in pop music: the electric 12-string guitar.<br><br>Rickenbacker is the guitar maker that brought the electric 12-string to market and has since been almost single-handedly responsible for establishing what such a guitar should do. The California company gave one of its earliest 12-strings to George Harrison of the Beatles on the group's first tour of the United States in 1964.

He divides his time between Thailand and France.<br>&nbsp;<br>www.john-burdett.com</p>1<br><br>Ours is an age of enforced psychosis. I&#x2019;ll forgive yours, <i>farang</i>, if you&#x2019;ll forgive mine&#x2014;but let&#x2019;s talk about it later. Right now I&#x2019;m on the back of a motorbike taxi hurtling toward a to-die-for little murder off Soi 4/4, Sukhumvit. My boss, Colonel Vikorn, called me at home with the good news that he wants me on the case because the victim is said to be some hyper-rich, hyper-famous Hollywood <i>farang</i> and he doesn&#x2019;t need poor Detective Sukum screwing up with the media. We&#x2019;ll get to Detective Sukum; for the moment picture me, if you will, a Eurasian Bangkok cop on my way to one of our most popular red-light districts with a Force 8 tropical wind in my face causing eyes to tear and ears to itch, where there awaits an overweight dead Westerner.<br><br>I&#x2019;m nearly there. With a little urging my motorbike jockey drives up onto the sidewalk to avoid the massive traffic jam at the Soi 4 junction with Sukhumvit, weaves in between a long line of cooked-food vendors busy feeding the whores from Nana Plaza who have just gotten up (it&#x2019;s about eleven in the morning), slaloms between a mango seller and a lamppost, returns to the tarmac with the usual jolt to the lower spine, and now we&#x2019;re slowing to swerve into Subsoi 4. (Should one add the two fours to make the lucky number eight, or should one accept the stark warning: two fours mean death twice within the Cantonese luck system, which has taken over the world as a vital component of globalization?) Finally, here we are with a couple of squad cars and a forensic van in the parking area of the flophouse to welcome yours truly on this fair morning.<br><br>Also waiting for me is my long-haired assistant, Lek, a <i>katoey</i>&#x2014; transsexual&#x2014;who has not yet scraped together the courage or the funds for the final op. He avoids the supernatural brightness in my eyes (I&#x2019;ve been meditating all night) to inform me, sotto voce, that Detective Sukum is here before me and has already developed possessive feelings toward the cadaver. The good Sukum is half a grade above me, and we are rivals for promotion. Like any jungle carnivore, Sukum is hunched over the kill as if it were all his own work&#x2014;and who can blame him? Necrophilia is a professional hazard on any murder squad, and I have no doubt my rival is slobbering over his magnificent prize, just as if he had come across the Koh-i-noor diamond in a sewer. Within the value system into which we were all inducted at cadet school, this murder is everyone&#x2019;s definition of <i>ruang yai:</i> a big one. It will be interesting to see how Sukum handles my inconvenient arrival. I think I might be able to surprise him.<br><br>Lek leads me past the guards&#x2019; hut into the parking deck which is also the entrance area for a ten-story apartment building that was erected in a hurry fifteen years ago in order to profit on a no-frills basis from the sexual frustration of Western men over the age of forty: a fail-proof business decision, the owners got their money back in the first three years and it&#x2019;s been honey all the way ever since. Paint is chipped and flaking from the walls, revealing white plaster with occasional graffiti (<i>Fuck you, farang</i>, in Thai; <i>Sarlee, you were so good last night</i>, in English); the lift is tiny&#x2014;even the slim Lek and I find ourselves embarrassingly close for a moment. (Our clash of colognes reveals our sexual orientations. He will use nothing less than Chanel No. 5, which he begs from my mother, Nong; mine is a rugged, take-no-prisoners little number from Armani.)<br><br>&#x201c;This could be one for the FBI,&#x201d; I say in the elevator.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s stuck in Virginia,&#x201d; Lek says. &#x201c;Poor little thing broke her arm during combat training. She was fighting two instructors at the same time, and of course they both came off worse, but she still can&#x2019;t really call herself one of the boys because she&#x2019;s in love with me. Don&#x2019;t tell her I said that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kimberley? Really?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She sent me an e-mail yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>Kimberley Jones, an FBI agent, is a friend of mine and Lek&#x2019;s. Especially Lek&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s a long story. She worked with me on a few cases of an international nature and fell in love with Lek, which awkward fact has confused the hell out of her. Does her lust for a transsexual make her a dyke or not? I fear there is little in your culture, farang, to provide guidance on this conundrum&#x2014;so she calls me all the time.<br><br>The corridor on the fourth floor leads to room 422, where two uniformed cops are stationed.<br><br>They part to let us into the apartment, where a massive dead American at least six feet long waits propped up in semi-sitting position on a bed wearing only a gigantic pair of shorts, over the top of which a great wormy mass of intestines has flopped like tripe in a butcher&#x2019;s shop. (His bed is so narrow that parts of his flesh sag over each side, and one has to wonder how he coped when engaged in sexual congress.) The drama of this center-screen image at first makes the various slim Thai cops and forensic technicians seem like a chorus to a Greek tragedy. Then Sukum steps forward.<br><br>Detective Sukum Montri is a good-looking Thai cop in his early thirties, very upright and proper when not consumed by fear, aggression, and lust&#x2014;like the rest of us; but right now I discern in his eyes the fire of one who has decided that this is the moment when the fig leaf of comradeship must be dropped by both protagonists to reveal the competing stiffness of their virile members. Well, I have good news for him: today, thanks to the way my psychosis is hanging, I&#x2019;m all metas&#x2014;Sanskrit for &#x201c;loving-kindness.&#x201d; However, it is important not to spoil people. I shall break the good news that I don&#x2019;t give a damn about promotion today&#x2014;or for the rest of my life&#x2014;later. For the moment, let us enjoy Sukum.<br><br>He wears a black jacket, black pants, white shirt, thin pink nylon tie (pink because it&#x2019;s Tuesday&#x2014;our days of the week are color coded), all items generic, i.e., not good enough to qualify as fakes. The jacket is particularly narrow at the shoulders, pinching under the arms and badly crumpled, even though I&#x2019;m sure it was freshly pressed yesterday. (Our gifted imitators of French and Italian haute couture would never be so crass; Sukum&#x2019;s tailor, if he has one, must be Thai Chinese of the old cloth-saving school.)<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Detective.&#x201d; I take careful note of the position of his hands as he wais me (palms pressed together and raised to mouth level, with precisely the right mindful pause), before I wai him back in exactly the same way. Sukum coughs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very kind of you to rush over to help me out,&#x201d; he says. I grunt noncommittally, causing a brief grin to cross Lek&#x2019;s face.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course your special input will be most welcome.&#x201d; Sukum is talking about my perfect English, which I learned from my mother&#x2019;s customers, and my half-farang blood, which gives me a unique insight into the mysterious Western mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes. But let&#x2019;s not get carried away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, absolutely.&#x201d;<br><br>Here Sukum drops his tone almost to a whisper. &#x201c;Let me be frank: the unwritten rule that you get farang murders only applies when the <i>murderer</i> is also <i>farang</i>. It doesn&#x2019;t apply when a Thai whore snuffs a farang.&#x201d;<br><br>I insert the pinkie of my left hand into my left ear, which is still itching from the motorbike ride, and work the wax around a bit. &#x201c;Really? Forgive me, Khun Sukum, but is there not a failure of logic in what you have just said? How would one know until the end of the case if the perp were Thai or <i>farang</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew you were going to say that,&#x201d; he snaps. &#x201c;Look, this is obviously a Thai hit.&#x201d; I ostentatiously move my eyes up and down the gash from the victim&#x2019;s solar plexus almost to the pubic area; the corpse is so massive it is hard to imagine a little Thai girl standing on tippy-toe so she can get a good angle with the boning knife. I allow Sukum a skeptical stare. &#x201c;Okay, it&#x2019;s a bit ambitious for a girl, but you know how they go when they get angry. Maybe he insisted on buggering her and she got mad&#x2014;our girls can be picky these days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But didn&#x2019;t I hear someone say that he&#x2019;s famous?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s a paid hit? Maybe, but if it&#x2019;s a hit, it&#x2019;s bound to be by a Thai. In Thailand ninety-nine point nine percent of professional hits are by Thais,&#x201d; he says patriotically.<br><br>&#x201c;Is that an official statistic? Perhaps you are right, Khun Sukum. Mind if I look around?&#x201d;<br><br>Mostly I&#x2019;m staring at the dead American. His hair is long and gray and swept back in a ponytail; a gray beard expands an already gigantic face. His mouth is half open, and a little blood is trickling from one corner. When I shift my glance to the rest of the apartment, I immediately become mesmerized by the books. It occurs to me that Sukum has no English.<br><br>I take a couple of surreptitious steps in the direction of the bookshelves, which are thinly populated with a set of novels and screenplays. My eyes fixate insanely when I come to a collection of short stories by Edgar Allan Poe. I turn my back so Sukum cannot see the intensely puzzled frown on my face, which only increases when I check the other titles. I finally manage to tear my eyes away, and pace the room for a moment. I am careful not to take any more notice of the bookshelves. For a moment my eyes rest on the cheap cathode-ray TV on a stand with a DVD player hooked up to it on a lower shelf.<br><br>&#x201c;Khun Sukum,&#x201d; I say, my hands clasped gently behind my back as I pace, &#x201c;would you do me the honor of indulging a whim of mine? Would you open the victim&#x2019;s mouth and tell me if you see there either a small pebble or an imago, or possibly both?&#x201d;<br><br>Suspicious, Sukum opens the giant&#x2019;s mouth and slips in his fingers, then pulls out a large black imago and a pebble. He is staring at me with fear, loathing, and envy-driven hatred. &#x201c;How in Buddha&#x2019;s name did you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I think, Khun Sukum, you had better examine the top of the victim&#x2019;s skull, in the area of the fontanel; you might want to pull at the hair in that area, give it a good tug, that&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br><br>As he does so, a large circular section of the skull, which amounts to the whole of the top of the head, comes away with the hair. Now we have a clear view of the victim&#x2019;s brain, still bright red under the protective membrane, but with a few folds missing from the left lobe.<br><br>When Sukum stares wildly at me, I allow my eyes to divert to a small and squalid coffee table on which a paper plate and a plastic spoon have been left. Now Sukum is shuddering involuntarily, Lek is astounded at my brilliance, and everyone is staring at me. I shrug. Sukum shakily replaces the victim&#x2019;s scalp, carefully trying to fit it into place like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that might get damaged if he forces it, then looks up at me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you did that; it must be your farang blood.&#x201d; I feel bad for him as I watch his ambition sag, his identity crumple. Finally, with weary detachment after a heroic inner struggle: &#x201c;Okay, it&#x2019;s your case, obviously the assassin was a <i>farang</i>, we don&#x2019;t have any Thai murderers that crazy.&#x201d;<br><br>I shake my head and tut. &#x201c;No, no, my dear Khun Sukum, I would not dream of standing between you and your life&#x2019;s ambition of becoming a detective sergeant. Wouldn&#x2019;t dream of it, my dear chap. Look, why don&#x2019;t you simply use me as a resource&#x2014;here&#x2019;s my private cell phone number, call me whenever you get stuck, hey?&#x201d;<br><br>Lek is pulling at my sleeve; he has something private and confidential to communicate. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ve got to go now, let&#x2019;s meet for a brainstorming session sometime soon. It&#x2019;s okay, your name will be on the file, I don&#x2019;t want any credit, just the honor of helping out in a spectacular case.&#x201d; I smile as Lek pulls me out of the room. At the door I add, &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve thought of it already, Detective Sukum, but just in case it has inexplicably escaped your notice, the victim was not staying here. No clothes or other signs of habitation, you see, only a few books. I would check with all the five-star hotels hereabout, if I were you.&#x201d; Sukum knows so little about <i>farang</i>, he still doesn&#x2019;t get it. &#x201c;He was probably hiring the room for sex, while living in some five-star suite at the Dusit Thani or something.&#x201d; Sukum nods, trying to get his head around the idea that someone might rent two hotel rooms at the same time, just to be discreet. Now that really does say <i>ruey ruey</i> in Thai: fabulously rich.<br><br>In the lift on the way back to the ground floor, a silent trickle of tears flows down Lek&#x2019;s cheeks.</p><h2>Titus Crow, Volume 1: The Burrowers Beneath; The Transition of Titus Crow</h2><p>The Titus Crow novels are adventure horror, full of acts of nobility and heroism, featuring travel to exotic locations and alternate planes of existence as Titus Crow and his faithful companion and record-keeper fight the gathering forces of darkness wherever they arise. The menaces are the infamous and deadly Elder Gods of the work of H.P. Lovecraft. Chthulu and his dark minions are bent on ruling the earth-or destroying it. A few puny humans cannot possibly stand against these otherworldly evil gods, yet time after time, Titus Crow defeats the monsters and drives them back into the dark from whence they came. Volume One contains two full novels, The Burrowers Beneath and The Transition of Titus Crow.</p><p>The two novels contained in the first volume of <i>Titus Crow</i>--"The Burrowers Beneath" and "The Transition of Titus Crow" (originally published in 1974 and 1975)--are a matched set marking the introduction of Brian Lumley's Sherlockian paranormal investigator, Titus Crow, and Crow's Watsonesque partner, Henri-Laurent de Marginy. Both tales are grounded in the Cthulu mythos originated by H.P. Lovecraft, but Lumley offers an effortless introduction to Cthulu for newcomers.<p> While Lumley is perhaps best known now for <i>Necroscope</i>, the Crow novels (which also include those collected in <i>Titus Crow, Volume Two</i> and <i>Titus Crow, Volume Three</i>) offer an early glimpse at the creative talents of a contemporary horror master. Crow is a fascinating character--an obsessed genius uncovering ancient gods in a late-20th-century world that is blind to its imminent destruction. At the same time, de Marginy, writing through epistles and journals, brings a naive immediacy to the narratives. Lumley's prose has a baroque feel that lends an antique patina to Crow's world (supposedly in the 1960s and '70s), and his blend of horror � la Lovecraft, adventure reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and techno-science fiction with shades of Asimov is always pleasantly surprising. <i>Titus Crow</i> makes for solid and enjoyable reading that deftly crosses genres. It's a pleasure to have these novels in a readily available form again. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>"I'm impressed with Lumley's talent. He's obviously one of the best writers in the field." --John Farris<p> "A worthwhile read indeed. Titus Crow is an engaging adventurer. Lumley takes his cue from the Lovecraft mythos. It's a wild, over-the-top ride, but told with the kind of imaginative writing that gives readers the unique sensation of feeling their minds open with the power of the writer's vision. Lumley's Titus Crow tales are a welcome, refreshing return to a larger canvas of ideas." --<i>Fangoria</i></p><p> "Those who enjoy being scared out of their wits will find plenty to like here. Lumley weaves horror, mystery, occultism, science fiction, and mythology into a wonderfully fascinating story. A wonderful reading experience." <i>Rapport</i></p><p> "It's nearly impossible to stop reading....Fans of Lovecraft in particular are in for a real treat as Lumley presents a modern horror saga based on the Lovecraft mythos. Readers will remain immersed--and surprised--throughout. Highly recommended indeed." --<i>The Bookwatch</i></p><p> "Lumley's style here is straight out of the classic pulp era, fast-paced and full of eerie landscapes and sinister plots. Titus Crow and his Watsonian sidekick, Henri Laurent de Marigny, face one danger after another with a mix of horrified fascination and grim determination. Lumley's settings are worthy of H.G. Wells as well as H.P. Lovecraft." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Monster Codex</h2><p><ul> <li>Take Monsters beyond the basics!

Even I want to be Cary Grant." <br>--Cary Grant <br>He is Hollywood's most fascinating and timeless star. Although he came to personify the debonair American, Cary Grant was born Archibald Leach on January 18, 1904, in the seaport village of Bristol, England. Combining the captivating beauty of silent-screen legend Rudolph Valentino with the masculine irresistibility of Clark Gable, Grant emerged as Hollywood's quintessential leading man. Today, "the man from dream city," as critic Pauline Kael once described him, remains forever young, an icon of quick wit, romantic charm, and urbane sophistication, the epitome of male physical perfection. Yet beneath this idealized movie image was a conflicted man struggling to balance fame with a desire for an intensely private life separate from the "Cary Grant" persona celebrated by directors and movie studios. <br>Exploring Grant's troubled childhood, ambiguous sexuality, and lifelong insecurities as well as the magical amalgam of characteristics that allowed him to remain Hollywood's favorite romantic lead for more than thirty-five years, Cary Grant is the definitive examination of every aspect of Grant's professional and private life, and the first to reveal the man behind the movie star. <br>Working with the most talented directors of his time, Grant starred in an astonishing seventy-two films, ranging from his groundbreaking comedic roles in such classics as Bringing Up Baby (Howard Hawks) and The Philadelphia Story (George Cukor) to the darker, unforgettable characters of Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion and Notorious, culminating in the consummate sophisticates of An Affair to Remember (Leo McCarey), North byNorthwest (Hitchcock), and Charade (Stanley Donen). The camera loved Grant, and his magnetism helped illuminate his leading ladies, some of the most glamorous women ever to grace the silver screen: Mae West, Irene Dunne, Katharine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, and Sophia Loren, among others. Yet, because of his pioneering role as an independent player, Grant was repeatedly denied the Oscar he coveted--a snub from the Academy that would last until 1970, when he graciously accepted a special lifetime achievement award. <br>Grant's sparkling image on-screen hid a tumultuous personal life that he tried desperately to keep out of the public eye, including his controversial eleven-year relationship with Randolph Scott, five marriages, and numerous affairs. <br>Rigorously researched and elegantly written, Cary Grant: A Biography is a complete, nuanced portrait of the greatest Hollywood star in cinema history. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>Marc Eliot has been writing about pop culture for more than twenty-five years and is the author of more than a dozen books translated into twenty-seven languages, including the critically acclaimed, award-winning biography <i>Walt Disney: Hollywood&#x2019;s Dark Prince</i> and, with Erin Brockovich, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Take It from Me</i>.

Under David&#x2019;s attentive gaze and in his clear, insightful prose the reader is enveloped in the rhythms of farm life; not only the planting and harvesting of crops throughout the year, but the migration patterns of birds, the health and virility of honeybees left nearly to their own devices, the songs and silences of frogs and toads, the disappearance and resurgence of praying mantises in fields-turned woodlands, the search for monarch butterflies in the milkweed. There&#x2019;s rhythm in community, too neighbors gathering to plant potatoes or to maintain an elderly friend&#x2019;s tomato garden, organic farming conferences and meetings around family dining tables or university panels.<br><br>Interspersed with local lore (when the spring&#x2019;s first bumblebee appears the children can go barefoot) is deep technical knowledge of cultivation and land management and the hazards of modern agri-business.

In these short essays, first published in the Amish magazine <i>Farm Life</i> and here introduced by Wendell Berry, Kline expresses his delight in nature (including probably the most beautiful of all batrachian sounds, the pure sustained trill of the American toad); speculates on connections between modern agricultural practices and the decline of wildlife populations; quotes other naturalists and scholars from Aristotle to Jean Henri Fabre to the latest academic researchers; instructs on the proper preparation of sassafras tea; and lets us in on countless small discoveries and observations. In thus sharing his Great Possessions, he comes across as a model of sanity, contentment, and generosity. And his inherited tradition of simple living, as supported here by wide ecological learning, is strikingly persuasive.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> He is an Amish Thoreau.&#x201d; Wes Jackson, author of <i>Consulting the Genius of the Place: An Ecological Approach to a New Agriculture</i><br><br><b>Praise for <i>Scratching the Woodchuck</i></b><br><br> Unlike the plethora of books intended to help renew and reassemble our disjointed, modern lives, <i>Scratching the Woodchuck</i> provides no instructions for being mindful, strengthening community, cherishing the natural world, deepening spirituality, or doing meaningful work. Instead, Amish farmer David Kline shares with readers a life wholly made of these fundamental things.&#x201d; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> Kline's thoroughly charming survey of the natural world . . . has much to teach us about appreciating wild things wherever we happen to be.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> A calm and peaceful book . . . David Kline is a wonderful voice for all of these observations.&#x201d; <i>Booklist</i><br><br> In this delightful book Kline instructs the reader about the nature and wildlife that he observes on his Ohio farm. But his underlying message is, not surprisingly, to take the time to appreciate the joys of life: the birds, trees, hayfields, streams, clouds, spring peepers?all of nature, including our fellow human beings . . . As a pleasant, instructive visit with an appreciative witness to nature, this book is recommended for all libraries.&#x201d; <i>Library Journal</i><br><br> If you want to know what the real world looks like, you had best read <i>Scratching the Woodchuck</i>. David Kline writes with joy, good humor, and style. I can't think of a book that's given me more pleasure in years.&#x201d; Bill McKibben<br><br> <i>Scratching the Woodchuck</i> is a wonderful book about the pleasures derived from a well loved and competently used place. David Kline and the Amish are national treasures.&#x201d; David Orr<br><br> David Kline is an alert observer of the natural world and its creatures, and an utterly pleasant and interesting companion.&#x201d; Wendell Berry<br><br> David Kline's vision goes beyond 20/20 into the realm of A/Z, where he eloquently uses all of the letters in between to delight us with his insights from his wide travels at home. He's an Amish Thoreau, except he scratches the woodchuck that Thoreau ate.&#x201d; Wes Jackson<br><br></p><h2>MIND MGMT Volume 1</h2><p>Reporting on a commercial flight where everyone aboard lost their memories, a young journalist stumbles onto a much bigger story, the topsecret Mind Management program.

Long admired as a fearless poet writing authentically erotic verse, Wright&#x2014;with her Southern accent and cinematic eye&#x2014;couples strangeness with uncanny accuracy to create poems that "offer a once-and-for-all thing, opaque and revelatory, ceaselessly burning."</p><p><b>from "Our Dust"</b></p><p>You didn&#x2019;t know my weariness, error, incapacity,<br>I was the poet<br>of shadow work and towns with quarter-inch<br>phone books, of failed<br>roadside zoos.

She teaches at Brown University and in 1994 was named State Poet of Rhode Island. With her husband, Forrest Gander, she edits Lost Roads Publishers.</p></p><p>C.D. Wright, a Professor of English at Brown University, is the author of eleven books of poetry, as well as several collaborative works with photographer Deborah Luster, most recently One Big Self: Prisoners of Louisiana. She has earned fellowships from the MacArthur and Guggenheim foundations, and is the recipient of a Lannan Literary Award. She lives in Rhode Island.Raised in remote Arkansas, Wright fell in when quite young with the charismatic and legendary poet Frank Stanford, whose neosurrealist techniques and sudden death inform her earliest work, included in this seventh full-length book, her first selected. Soon, however, Wright had many other forms and models from Adrienne Rich to Edmond Jabes, from philosophical investigations to yearbook signatures and personal ads. Together and separately, these techniques produced the striking power and variety of String Light (1991), which declared Wright "the poet/ of shadow work and towns with quarter-inch/ phone books," "of yard eggs and/ sharpening shops" and of sex and female physicality, for whom "the body would open its legs like a book." Tremble (1996) confirmed these strengths and added a durable visionary dimension: "As surely as there are crumbs on the lips/ of the blind," one poem began, "I came for a reason." This collection draws liberally on those volumes, as well as the book-length Southern travelogue-cum-prose-poem Deepstep Come Shining (1998), and adds new sets of short poems. Some derive from Mexican retablos (folk-art altarpieces), which they imagine in strenuous, broken-up lines; a final series considers, and sometimes addresses, the incarcerated: "I too love. Faces. Hands. The circumference/ Of the oaks. I confess. To nothing/ You could use. In a court of law." Multicultural (with a Southern orientation) and experimental, challenging and immediately appealing, Wright has a core of fans but could have many more: this book's careful selection from a strong body of work should ensure that they find her.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Nonprofit Consulting Playbook: Winning Strategies from 25 Leaders in the Field (In the Trenches)</h2><p><p>What if you could sit down with 25 successful consultants and ask them what makes their businesses tick?</p> <p>In <strong>The Nonprofit Consulting Playbook: Winning Strategies from 25 Leaders in the Field,</strong> Susan Schaefer and Linda Lysakowski have compiled a first-of-its-kind insight into the everyday lives of consultants to the nonprofit sector.

Burton lives in Oklahoma with her husband and dogs.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zach Powers read over the list of grades, then scanned down to his two football players who had been placed on academic probation. His gaze narrowed when he saw which teacher had been the one to put them there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Josie Barnes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Dammit, Josie." He clenched the paper in his fist and left his classroom in search of the woman who was trying to ruin Hope High School's football season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He found her in her classroom, looking work-like and gorgeous in her long skirt and white short-sleeved button-down shirt, so unlike the outfits she wore outside the classroom. Here at school, she was buttoned up and professional, always nodding in greeting in the halls but never giving away anything other than polite teacher-to-teacher glances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When they were out with their friends, though, she flirted with him. Nothing had happened between them yet, but Zach knew she liked him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He liked her, too. Or he had, until now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He knocked on her classroom door. She looked over and waved him in. She always wore her hair cut short, which did nothing to detract from her stunning face. In fact, it brought out the amazing sea blue of her eyes and her generous mouth, which today was painted a pale, shimmering pink. Which he shouldn't be noticing while they were at school, but whatever. Classes were out for the day, so her room was empty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If she'd been his teacher, he would have never been able to concentrate. Like right now, when he was supposed to be pissed off about those grades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He opened the door and closed it behind him, then walked toward her desk and stopped to hover over it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's this all about?" he asked, shaking the paper at her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at his hand, then raised her gaze to his face. "What's what all about?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You put Paul Fine and Chase Satterfield on probation."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She leaned back in her chair and gave him a confused look. "I have no idea what you're talking about."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He dropped the paper on her desk. She opened it up, read it, then lifted her gaze to his. "Oh. Football."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She said the word <i>football</i> as if she had no idea what the word meant. That word meant everything to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah, football. You know, the thing that's my life here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Huh. I thought teaching history was your life here." She finished her statement with an arched brow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He narrowed his gaze at her. "Don't play games with me, Josie. Paul's my best wide receiver, and Chase is my center."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Uh-huh. Whatever. We're four weeks into the semester, and Paul's missing four assignments. Chase is missing five. Which means neither of them is passing my class. I'm just doing what the school board requires by submitting progress reports."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zach clenched his jaw. Bureaucracy always got in the way of his players doing what they did best-playing football. Some of the other teachers understood this and were more . . . lenient with grades for his players, giving them a sliding scale to work with so they could catch up. But those instances were typically for players who were on the cusp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Five assignments? Jeez.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He took another glance at Paul's and Chase's grades in the class. They were both Fs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't like you could "sliding scale" your way up to a passing grade when you were already so far down the hole that the fires of hell were licking at your ass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Damn kids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How bad is it?" he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Take a look."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She took out her grade book and showed him. "Chase has only turned in one assignment. Paul two. And the two Paul turned in-" She looked up at him. "I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, Zach, but honestly? They were bad. I couldn't even say he was phoning it in. He hasn't even picked up the phone."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was where he needed to remind himself these were high school students. High school students who had potential college careers ahead of them, which meant they'd have to be able to do the academic work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He unclenched his jaw. "Fine. Tell me what they need to get done, and I'll make sure it's turned in before you submit this week's grade report."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Probation was one thing. If his players were suspended, they'd be off the team for God only knew how long. Bad for them, very bad for Hope High's Eagles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure." She got out a piece of paper, opened her laptop, and jotted down the list of assignments. When she handed it to Zach, she looked up at him. "And, Zach, make sure they're the ones doing the assignments, okay?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What the hell does that mean?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It means not bullying any of my stellar students to do the work for them. Or, even worse, buying the work online. Because I'll know it if they do."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Christ, Josie. What kind of guy do you think I am? What kind of guys do you think my athletes are?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She sighed. "Let's just say I've seen students like this before. They get in a jam and they're desperate, and more than willing to do anything-and I mean anything-to turn in passing work."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He laid his hands on her desk and leaned in. "My guys aren't like that. And if they are, they won't play for me for long."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She didn't flinch. She held his gaze. "I guess you should make sure you know your players well, then."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I intend to, because these two will be sitting with me every day after school this week doing these assignments while their teammates are on the practice field. So I can guarantee you, Ms. Barnes, that when this work is turned in, it'll be work that both Paul and Chase have done themselves."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her lips lifted. "I'm glad to hear that. And I'm sorry about all that classwork you'll have to do this week. If you need any research assistance, feel free to give me a call."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I think I can handle it. After all, I've been to school myself, ya know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She laughed. "Yes, I'm sure you're great and all. But that was a long time ago. And I require a lot of my students."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How hard can it be?" He scanned the assignments and bit back a curse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Poetry? A journal of thoughts and feelings? Aww, hell, Josie."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She smiled. "You did say you were going to help them, right?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He pushed off the desk and pivoted, already halfway to the door. "Yeah, yeah."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once out the door, he stopped and read the assignments again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poetry. Journals. Ugh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A small part of him understood why Paul and Chase were blowing off the homework. He'd hated poetry in English class. All that evaluation of shit that had never made sense to him. But he'd sucked it up and done it. And had maybe learned a few things in the process. He might not have enjoyed it, but he'd done the work. Because not doing the work would have meant he couldn't play football. And he'd have done anything to play football.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>High school football had gotten him into college so he could play football there. And college football had paved the way for him to play pro football. All of which had taken a hell of a lot of sweat and hard work. Some of that work had been schoolwork. And some of that schoolwork hadn't been fun, but it had been necessary to get him where he'd wanted to be, which was the pros.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He needed to remind his kids of the long-term goal. Plus, not doing the work was lazy, and he wouldn't accept that from any of his players.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He headed toward the field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time to kick a couple of asses from here to next week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Josie pondered her conversation with Zach all the way home, then ended up gravitating toward the library, where she hoped Jillian Reynolds would be working this afternoon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd made friends with so many wonderful women in the time she'd been here in Hope, Oklahoma. And friendship was a new thing to her. She hadn't had much of that in her lifetime. Or any friendship, really.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she and Jillian had grown closer in the past few months, likely because out of their group of women friends, they were the two single ones. Everyone else was either coupled up or married, and several of their friends had kids or were expecting. So Josie and Jillian had started hanging out more and more lately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, it didn't hurt that they had a lot of things in common. Jillian was the head librarian, and she had an appreciation for all forms of literature. A language arts teacher, Josie had loved books and reading from the time she was a kid. She had started hanging out in her local library as a means of escape from family drama, but her refuge had turned into a love of reading that had developed into a voracious appetite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She could still remember Elda, the librarian at her small-town library, who'd introduced her to countless books when she was a kid. She'd fallen in love with classic literature and poetry and mysteries and romances and science fiction and fantasy. She'd returned day after day to turn one book in and check out another. She'd also spent hours at the back of the library reading and soaking in the quiet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After all, no one was drunk or high or screaming at her while she was there. It was peaceful, and she could lose herself in a story of magic or fantastical worlds or escape into romantic escapades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading had been her life, and the library had been her salvation. While at the library, her head in a book, her mind in a story, she was someone else. She could <i>be</i> somewhere else. She could escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that had been nirvana. At least for a couple of hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meeting Jillian had evoked warm memories of those early years because Jillian ran her library the same way Elda had all those years ago. She was fierce and protective and fostered a love of books in every kid she met.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just walking into the Hope library settled a feeling of calm over her. Josie always thought it was the smell of books that made her feel that way. There was nothing like it anywhere else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She spotted Jillian in her office at the back of the library, so she headed in that direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jillian was working on her computer. Josie didn't want to interrupt her, but Jillian happened to look up and smiled, then motioned for her to come in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Josie opened the door, then closed it behind her. "You looked busy. I didn't want to bother you. I just stopped in to say hello."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's okay. I was ordering some books."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Josie sighed and took a seat. "Ordering books. How fun."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Always. How was your day?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good, mostly. Until after school when Zach came into my room and told me I was ruining his football team."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jillian leaned back in her chair. "Really. And how did you manage to ruin his team?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A couple of his players aren't passing my class, so now they're on probation."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, Josie. How could you? Don't you know football is king here?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Uh-huh. Well, in my classroom, literature is king, and I'd like my students to do their assignments. And actually pass the class."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So did you two have words? Was it a hot and passionate argument?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jillian always turned any heated discussion into a hot and passionate argument. In her imagination, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No. I gave him their assignments, and he's going to work with them this week so probation doesn't turn into a suspension."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How disappointing. I mean, not for the kids, of course. But I was hoping you two would end up making out on your desk."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Josie laughed. "I don't think the principal would appreciate that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Who cares what the principal appreciates? I would have appreciated it immensely."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I think you need a hot guy to come make out with you across your desk."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't I ever." Jillian waggled her brows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He's out there for you somewhere."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jillian waved her hand. "Not looking for him. I'm busy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Josie sighed. "Aren't we both. Which doesn't mean I'd turn down some hot guy throwing me across anything and making out with me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jillian pointed a finger at her. "See? You wouldn't have turned down Zach throwing you across your desk."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Josie laughed. "That wasn't the topic of conversation at the time."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But you like him."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, I like him. Most days, anyway. Just not this afternoon."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They fortunately got off the topic of Zach and onto other things, mainly Loretta and Deacon's deck party this weekend and what they were going to take, food-wise. Then Josie left so Jillian could get back to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she still stewed about Zach on the way home. He could be so sweet to her when they were all out with their friends. Today, though, he'd been hot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Angry hot, not sexy hot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then again, angry hot could be sexy. Just not when the mad was directed at her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, at school, they had to be all business. Teenagers had the uncanny ability to zero in on any type of flirting or attraction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Working with someone you were attracted to had its disadvantages. And she didn't know how she was going to handle it. Because she and Zach had been dancing around each other for months now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So far, nothing had happened between them other than friendly hanging out in groups with their mutual friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe that was all it would ever be. But as she thought back, there'd been glances. And touches that felt like a lot more than just casual friendliness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So maybe it wouldn't be just friendship between them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't like she was looking for a relationship. The last one she'd been in had ended badly-really badly-and she wasn't looking forward to wading in those waters again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But still . . . Zach was impossibly tall and had great biceps. She really had a thing for biceps. Plus, he was incredibly good-looking, with dark hair and those steely gray eyes that could catch and hold her attention like nothing Josie had ever experienced. That man could make her melt faster than a stick of frozen butter in the hot August sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So maybe she'd just dip a toe in and test the waters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She just wouldn't go for a swim.</p></p><h2>The Silver Nutmeg: The Story of Anna Lavinia and Toby</h2><p>Anna Lavinia&#x2019;s father wanted her to have another point of view, so what did he do? He made a peephole in the garden wall. But he couldn&#x2019;t have known that this new view would lead Anna Lavinia all the way to the upside-down mirror land that lies on the other side of the pond. Here Anna Lavinia meets Toby, who explains that on the other side, instead of gravity, there&#x2019;s something called &#x201c;the tingle,&#x201d; which feels like &#x201c;the tickle that comes before a sneeze, or the thrill that comes when the knot in a ribbon just begins to loosen,&#x201d; and allows for floating and spectacular feats of tree-climbing (but mind your furniture doesn&#x2019;t drift away!). Toby introduces Anna Lavinia to a variety of wonders and oddballs, including an uncanny fortune-teller, a turtle with a jungle on its back, and Aunt Cornelia, who&#x2019;s never quite recovered from the disappearance of a certain young man into Anna Lavinia&#x2019;s world a very long time ago.<br><br><i>The Silver Nutmeg</i> continues the adventures begun in <i>Beyond the Pawpaw Trees</i>, and features loads of sense, a little nonsense, and more charming verses from Anna Lavinia&#x2019;s favorite book of rhymes. Best of all, fans of Palmer Brown&#x2019;s intricate drawings will find every page a delight for the eyes</p><p>Palmer Brown (1920-2012) was born in Chicago and attended Swarthmore and the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author and illustrator of five books for children, including <i>Beyond the Pawpaw Trees</i> and its sequel, <i>The Silver Nutmeg</i>; <i>Cheerful</i>; and<i> Hickory</i>. About <i>Beyond the Pawpaw Tree</i>s, his first published book, Brown said: &#x201c;If it has any moral at all, it is hoped that it will always be a deep secret between the author and those of his readers who still know that believing is seeing.&#x201d;&#x201c;This is a book more for boys than for girls, but boys how like &#x2018;Alice in Wonderland&#x2019; will probably find this enjoyable. It is about Anna Lavinia (the girl in &#x2018;Beyond the PawPaw Trees&#x2019;) whose father thought she needed broader horizons. So he tore down their garden wall to accomplish this. Lavinia meets a boy who named Tobey and together they romp in his land of no gravity. The illustrations are delicate; the text is imaginative and poetic. This is a book for the child who loves fantasy&#x201d; &#x2013;<i> Boston Globe</i><br> &nbsp;<br> A companion volume to <i>Beyond the Pawpaw Trees</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Praise for <i>Beyond the Pawpaw Trees:</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Brilliant . . . it may prove the special treasure of many.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New York Herald Tribune</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A fantasy for girls who have lively imaginations.

Among the effects of a dead passenger, they come across a set of notebooks that tell of his life. As the boy reads the story to his elderly companion, this story and their own develop in tandem.

He has been active as a journalist and during the revolutionary struggle headed the AIM news agency. He now lives in Maputo where he works as an environmental biologist and runs the Mozambique part of the Kruger National Park.<i>Starred Review.</i> Heralded as one of the 12 best African books of the 20th century by the Zimbabwe International Book Fair, Couto's first novel, a colorfully harsh portrayal of war-torn Mozambique, is as seductive in detail as it is loaded with symbolism. Two refugees of the country's bloody protracted civil war, begun with its independence in 1975, seek safety in a charred bus. Muidinga, a boy recovering from illness, and Tuahir, an elderly companion from the refugee camp they have fled, bide their time by reading the notebooks of a nearby corpse of a young man, Kindzu. The entries recount, in a wonderfully rich idiom, Kindzu making his way in a shattered world, including his attempts to become a naparama, or warrior of justice. As he explores a beached ship, he comes upon a beautiful woman named Farida, who provides a mission worthy of his ambitions: to find and return her lost son, Gaspar. Like Garc�a M�rquez, Couto, a white writer from Mozambique who is the author of <i>The Flight of the Flamingo</i> and <i>Under the Frangipani</i>, flirts with magic realism to compound the chaos of a newly independent state. He delivers a brutally absorbing tale of those who suffered a devastated country's vicissitudes. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her characters&#x2014;young women struggling to find happiness, love, success, security, and adventure&#x2014;wait tables, run away from home, fall for married men, betray their friends, and find themselves betrayed as well. </p> <p> In "Hungry Self," a young waitress descends into the basement of a seemingly ordinary Chinese restaurant; in "Twenty Grand," a young wife tries to recover her lost fortune; in "Monsters," one family's paranoia leads to a sacrifice; and in "The Witches," an innocent swim on prom night proves more dangerous than anyone could have imagined. With elegant prose and a wicked sense of humor, these stories reveal Curtis's provocative and uncompromising view of life, one that makes her writing so poignant and irresistible. </p></p><p><p>Rebecca Curtis's writing has appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, including its debut fiction issue, as well as in <em>Harper's</em>, <em>McSweeney's</em>, and <em>n+1</em>. She is a recipient of a Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers' Award, and her work has been selected for <em>The O. Henry Prize Stories</em>. She teaches in the graduate writing program at Columbia University.</p>Mostly female loners, outsiders and have-nots populate this marvelous, bleak debut collection. A young woman extracts herself from an overly insistent blind date who violates her privacy in Big Bear, California, only to find her usual certainty shaken years later by the memory of his grasping, petulant behavior. In Summer, with Twins, a college-age woman waitressing during the break wavers in declining her greasy boss's indecent proposal, perpetuating a crisis of self-worth that reverberates through her tenuous summer friendships. Among the 13 pieces, surreal vignettes serve as a taut, dramatic counterpart to the more straightforward narratives: The Wolf at the Door in particular has a being-chased-in-your-dreams feel of danger and terror, as a woman battles to keep an anthropomorphic wolf from entering her house, until he asks her to open the door and her sister insists that she do so, saying, it's polite! Delving into extremes of monotonous oppression, Curtis describes a reality that must be endured: her characters cling fiercely to their rationalizations, but even the more avaricious are sympathetic. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cassie Beaumont lamented to her best friend.<br><br>Angie Barber looked up from her microscope and seemed to take an extra moment to consider what Cassie had just said. "You got a Christmas card? Already?"<br><br>Cassie wheeled her chair back to her station. "Can you believe it?"<br><br>"Who from?"<br><br>"An old college friend. You wouldn't know her." Cassie shrugged. "Jill married Tom two weeks after we graduated."<br><br>"They have children?"<br><br>Cassie caught the wisp of longing in Angie's voice and answered with a nod. "Two, a boy and a girl, and of course they're adorable."<br><br>"Of course," Angie echoed.<br><br>The Christmas card photo showed the four of them in matching outfits of green and red. The mother and daughter wore full-length green dresses with red-and-green plaid skirts. Father and son had on three-piece suits with vests in the same fabric as the dress skirts. It was too adorable for words.<br><br>"There was a letter, as well."<br><br>"Everything in their lives is perfect, right?" Angie asked.<br><br>"Perfect in every way," Cassie grumbled. The unfairness of it all was too much. Jill, who worked as a financial planner, held down a forty-hour-a-week job, kept a meticulous house and <em>still</em> managed to be a terrific wife and mother. Despite all the demands on her time, she'd mailed out her Christmas cards a full month in advance.<br><br>"Is there a reason the perfect Jill sent her Christmas cards so soon?" Angie asked.<br><br>"Jill and Tom just moved into a new home and wanted to update family and friends with their address change. Oh, and there was a photo of the house and it was&#x2014;"<br><br>"Perfect," Angie finished for her.<br><br>"Perfect doesn't begin to describe it."<br><br>Angie watched her closely. "Do I detect a slight note of envy?" she asked.<br><br>"Slight envy? Me?" Cassie asked, exaggerating the words. "Heavens, no. What you're hearing is a full-blown case of jealousy. The green-eyed monster is alive and well." Cassie rolled her chair to the end of a counter filled with an assortment of microscopes, test tubes, slides and other equipment, then stood, hands propped on her hips. "Do you realize how long it's been since I've been on a real date?"<br><br>"You went out with Greg last week," Angie reminded her.<br><br>"Greg isn't a man," Cassie blurted out. "I mean, he is, but not in the sense of someone I'm interested in," she said. "Greg's...completely unsuitable as marriage material." She didn't need to explain that, at thirty-four, the ticking of her biological clock got louder by the year.<br><br>Angie sighed. "I agree."<br><br>He was eligible in practically every way but he happened to be divorced and in love with his ex-wife. Unfortunately, he hadn't figured that out yet. The entire date, if it could even be called a date, was spent rehashing the tragedy of his divorce. He went on and on about how much he missed his three kids&#x2014;and his ex-wife, if the number of times he mentioned her name was any indication. The night had been sheer drudgery for Cassie. It was her first and last date with Greg.<br><br>"The problem is, we don't meet many guys here at work," Angie said. Cassie was well aware of that. Since they were holed up in a lab eight to ten hours a day, working as biochemists for a plastics company, the opportunities to socialize outside the job were limited.<br><br>"What really hit home," Cassie said, "after receiving that Christmas card, is how badly I want a family of my own."<br><br>"I know." The longing was back in Angie's voice, too. "I don't understand why it's so hard to meet men. I'm reasonably attractive, right?"<br><br>Angie nodded enthusiastically. "Yes." "Thirty-four isn't so old, is it?" "Not really."<br><br>Cassie shook her head and wondered why she was still single. She <em>wanted</em> to be married, and she liked to think she had the full package&#x2014;five-five, dark hair, dark eyes. She was attractive, as Angie had confirmed, and she was smart, with a successful career, an engaging personality (if she did say so herself) and plenty of friends. "I blame my mother for this."<br><br>"Your mother?"<br><br>"I blame my father, too, even if he didn't stick around all that long."<br><br>"Or maybe <em>because</em> he didn't stick around."<br><br>"Yeah, I guess. After the divorce, my mother was so down on marriage, the whole idea terrified me."<br><br>"But it doesn't anymore, does it?"<br><br>"No. I want a husband and I'd really like children." She grinned. "The ironic thing is, my mother's remarried."<br><br>"Marriage seems to terrify your brother, too. Shawn should be married by now, don't you think? He's older than you are."<br><br>"I'm not so sure about Shawn." Cassie sometimes wondered if Angie might be interested in her brother. There was actually nothing to indicate that, but every once in a while Cassie had this <em>feeling...</em>. "He travels so much that maintaining a long-term relationship would be difficult for him." "True," Angie said.<br><br>Shawn was a well-known artist who painted murals all over the country. Brother and sister were close and kept in touch, calling each other two or three times a week. Currently Shawn was in Boca Raton, Florida, painting the side of a building that stood next to the freeway. He'd sent her photos of the mural from his cell phone&#x2014;an ocean scene, which Cassie knew was his favorite. Whales rising up out of the crashing waves. Dolphins and sea turtles and all kinds of fish frolicked in the sparkling blue water. His murals made headlines wherever he went and huge crowds showed up to watch him paint.<br><br>"Shawn's a different case," Cassie said. In her opinion, that summed up the situation pretty accurately.<br><br>"But if you were married, I bet he'd show some interest in finding a wife," Angie commented.<br><br>Cassie had never thought of their family dynamic in those terms. Perhaps, in some obscure way, Shawn <em>was</em> waiting for her to make the leap first. Angie might be right. It wasn't that Shawn followed her lead&#x2014;far from it. They'd both been traumatized by the divorce and by their mother's reaction. Their father, who wanted his kids to call him Pete, had been in and out of their lives. Mostly out and yet...yet he'd had a powerful influence on his children, whom he rarely recognized as such.<br><br>"Shawn won't feel marriage is safe until he sees <em>you</em> happily married," Angie went on to say.<br><br>Cassie scowled at her friend. "What makes you so smart?"<br><br>"Just an observation," Angie said. "I may not be correct, but it seems to me that you and Shawn are afraid of love."<br><br>"Me afraid of love? Hardly." Not if the longing in her heart was anything to go by. Like her friend Jill, she wanted it all.<br><br>"Whenever you meet a man&#x2014;no matter how perfect he is&#x2014;you find fault with him," Angie said.<br><br>Now, <em>that</em> was categorically untrue. "Not so," Cassie argued.<br><br>"Oh, it's all wine and roses in the beginning, but then it's over before you even have a chance to really know the guy."<br><br>"How can you say that?"<br><br>"Well, mostly," Angie told her softly, "I can say it because I've seen you do it again and again."<br><br>"You're not talking about me and Jess, are you? The man had no class. He scratched his private parts in public!"<br><br>"Not Jess."<br><br>"Who do you mean, then?"<br><br>"Rod."<br><br>Cassie cocked her head. "Rod? Rod who?"<br><br>"I don't remember his last name. You went out with him a year ago."<br><br>"Not Rod Showers? Good grief, he was so cheap I had to pay for my half of the meal and tip the valet because he refused to do it."<br><br>"What about Charles..."<br><br>Cassie got the point quickly enough. "Okay, okay, so I have standards." "High standards."<br><br>"Okay, fine. High standards." Cassie had made the effort, though. "I've <em>tried</em> to meet men."<br><br>"We both have."<br><br>"I had hopes for that online dating service." The advertisements had looked so promising. Cassie and Angie had signed up together and then waited expectantly to meet their perfect matches.<br><br>It didn't happen.<br><br>"I had real hopes for that, too," Angie returned sadly. "I thought for sure we'd meet really wonderful husbands."<br><br>Cassie sighed. That had been an expensive venture. Her expectations had been great and her disappointment greater. Angie's, too. In fact, Angie was the one who'd suggested trying the Internet.<br><br>"The church singles group was a good idea," she said now.<br><br>"A great idea," Cassie concurred, "if there'd been any men involved."

"The pickings were few and far between."<br><br>"We've read all the right books," Cassie said. <em>"Dating for Dummies.

For too long she'd been convinced that one day soon, she'd be mailing glossy Christmas cards to all <em>her</em> friends and relatives. She, too, would have a photograph that showed the perfect husband, the perfect children, a boy and a girl, all looking forward to the perfect Christmas. But year after year it was the same. No husband. No children. And each Christmas with her embittered mother more depressing than the one before.<br><br>The time had come to step forward and find a man, she decided with new resolve.

On the western horizon is the pinnacle of Skellig Michael-700 feet of vertical rock rising out of exploding seas. Somewhere on the isolated island are sixth-century monastic ruins where the light of civilization was kept burning during the Dark Ages by early Christian Irish monks. Puffins surface a few yards from the boat, as hundreds of gannets wheel overhead on six foot wing spans. The ocean rises violently and tosses paddler and boat as if they were discarded flotsam. This is just one day of Chris Duff's incredible three month journey.</p></p><p>"Every time I thought I had reached the peak, that the passion for the journey must certainly begin to wane, I would stumble on another experience that pulled me onward," writes Chris Duff, recounting his solo circumnavigation of Ireland by sea kayak in the summer of 1996. "Stroke by stroke, four miles an hour, Ireland was filling me with its life blood." Beginning and ending in Dublin, Duff paddled 1,200 miles over the course of three months. Sometimes he piloted his frail craft through waters too tumultuous even for hardy local fisherman; other times he sought refuge in sixth-century monastic ruins on coastal islands or waited out storms for days on end in his tent. In this sense, Duff's journey is a study in contrasting worlds: land and sea; past and present; solitude and society. The story's suspense comes not from a questionable outcome but in the surprise of daily encounters. Who or what relic of the past will the author stumble upon next? Ultimately it is Duff's openness to ancient and elemental forces, expressed in starkly honest prose, that propels his narrative through the churning waters of Irish history and landscape. But this is also the story of a sea kayaker at the top of his game, dealing with nature's harsh blows and quiet caresses. <i>--Kristopher Kaiyala</i>"Chris Duff's <i>On Celtic Tides</i> is a descriptively beautiful blend of adventure, brotherhood, mystery, philosophy, history and self-fulfillment. It is an anthem to life and life's rewarding pursuits among the waves, the heather, the country folk of Ireland...yet not just Ireland, but the world at large." --Larry Kaniut, Bestselling author of <i>ALASKA BEAR TALES</i><p> "The power of this voyage is often tempered with remarkable intimacy. I recommend you take a ride at wave level with Chris Duff as he fights his way through ferocious seas, then brings you closer to a truly enchanted isle." --David Hays, Co-author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>MY OLD MAN AND THE SEA</i></p><p> "A tender and terrifying story. No one has written better of huge, cold seas in a very small boat, of self discovery in the face of fear, and of gentle moments with Irish people." --Audrey Sutherland, 10,000 mile solo world paddler and Author of <i>PADDLING MY OWN CANOE</i> and <i>PADDLING HAWAII</i></p><p> "Chris Duff vividly evokes the experience of ocean kayaking, in all its extremes and subtleties. He captures the rhythms of a long journey by kayak, and his accounts of paddling the unpredictable seas around the coast of Ireland are absolutely gripping." --Maria Coffey, Author of <i>A BOAT IN OUR BAGGAGE: Around the World With a Kayak</i></p></p><h2>The Directive: A Novel (Mike Ford, 2)</h2><p><strong>A <b>pulse-pounding thriller about two brothers, billions of dollars, and the heist of a lifetime by </b></strong><strong><b><strong><b>the author of the national bestseller <i>The 500</i></b></strong>.</b><br><br></strong>After escaping the corrupt back rooms of Washington, DC, Mike Ford is again playing a dangerous game--and this time the stakes are even higher. <br><br>Mike's brother is in over his head in a powerful conspiracy to steal a secret worth billions from the rarely understood, vitally important trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

But his plan to live a quiet, respectable life is sorely threatened when his older brother, Jack, drags him into a job to steal the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s directive on monetary policy prior to a major announcement, opening up a two-hour window for some serious insider training. Mike, resourceful and well-schooled in cons and grifts from childhood by his ex-con father, plans to blow up the job from the inside until the lives of his fianc�e, Annie Clark (daughter of a megarich hedge-fund operator), and his father are threatened. Then it becomes a deadly race to learn who&#x2019;s behind it all&#x2014;keeping in mind his father&#x2019;s advice to &#x201c;never bet in another man&#x2019;s game&#x201d;&#x2014;and come out of the mess as best he can.

Quirk has another high-powered hit on his hands. --Michele Leber</p><h2>The Buddhist Literature of Ancient Gandhara: An Introduction with Selected Translations (Classics of Indian Buddhism)</h2><p><b>Discover the fascinating history of a long-hidden Buddhist culture at a historic crossroads.</b><br><br>In the years following Alexander the Great&#x2019;s conquest of the East, a series of empires rose up along the Silk Road. In what is now northern Pakistan, the civilizations in the region called Gandhara became increasingly important centers for the development of Buddhism, reaching their apex under King Kaniska of the Kusanas in the second century CE. Gandhara has long been known for its Greek-Indian synthesis in architecture and statuary, but until about twenty years ago, almost nothing was known about its literature. The insights provided by manuscripts unearthed over the last few decades show that Gandhara was indeed a vital link in the early development of Buddhism, instrumental in both the transmission of Buddhism to China and the rise of the Mahayana tradition. <i>The Buddhist Literature of Ancient Gandhara</i> surveys what we know about Gandhara and its Buddhism, and it also provides translations of a dozen different short texts, from similes and stories to treatises on time and reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Professor <b>Richard G. Salomon</b> of the University of Washington is a leading figure in the field of early Buddhist studies. He directs the Early Buddhist Manuscripts Project and is general editor of the <i>Gandharan Buddhist Texts</i> series published by the University of Washington Press. He lives in Seattle, Washington.&#x201c;This wonderful book provides tantalizing glimpses of a forgotten Buddhist&nbsp;civilization, one that flourished at the geographical crossroads of Indian,&nbsp;Persian, Hellenistic, and Central Asian cultures around the time of Christ. A&nbsp;world rich in religious devotion, human conflict, and philosophical reflection&nbsp;emerges as though by magic from the meticulous reading by a dedicated&nbsp;group of scholars of fragile textual fragments written on birchbark. The book&nbsp;not only introduces us to ancient Gandhara but also enriches our&nbsp;understanding of the complex currents of ideas that formed the diverse&nbsp;Buddhist traditions of India, Central Asia, and China.&#x201d; Author: Stephen Batchelor, author of After Buddhism<br><br>"Every now and then, the adventure of scholarship leaps from the pages of a book. With a detective&#x2019;s eye and a storyteller&#x2019;s pen, Professor Salomon shares a scholar&#x2019;s delight in these Silk Road texts and contexts." Author: Hozan Alan Senauke, Berkeley Zen Center<br><br>&#x201c;This book opens a window on an early phase of Buddhist literary history that only a century ago seemed lost forever. It is a testament to the indefatigable efforts of a small band of scholars, led by Richard Salomon himself, who have toiled to make this precious material accessible to us. Working with fragile and often fragmentary manuscripts written in a nearly lost language, these scholars have been able to reconstruct an astonishingly detailed picture of the Gandhari Buddhist literary culture that once flourished in a region now corresponding to northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. The texts of Gandhari Buddhism presented in this work strikingly demonstrate the essential unity of the early Buddhist tradition even across widely separated geographical regions.&#x201d; Author: Bhikkhu Bodhi, author of In the Buddha&#x2019;s Words<br><br>&#x201c;The recent discovery of hundreds of Buddhist manuscripts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, written in the ancient Gandhari language, has revolutionized our understanding of the early history of Buddhism. In this remarkable book Richard Salomon gives the reader a glimpse into a lost world of Buddhist thought and practice, in which the Theravada was only one of many Buddhist schools, each of which composed and transmitted its own version of the Buddha&#x2019;s words. This work makes available several previously unknown Buddhist texts, as well as new versions of scriptures known only in Pali.&#x201d;<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The author has been a pioneer in the decipherment and translation of these previously unknown scriptures. Until now the study of Gandhari texts has been a highly technical field accessible only to specialists, but here Salomon makes the fruits of more than two decades of study accessible to general readers and specialists alike. This stunning achievement belongs on the bookshelf of every reader who is interested in the history of Buddhism.&#x201d; Author: Jan Nattier, author of A Few Good Men: The Bodhisattva Path according to &#x201c;The Inquiry of Ugra&#x201d;</p><h2>Why the Church?</h2><p>Giussani begins by focusing on the Church as a community composed of people who are aware of themselves as defined by the gift of the Spirit, from which they derive a new conception of existence, the fruit of conversion. He then describes the Church&#39;s developing self-awareness of its dual elements of the human and divine. Concerned with verifying the Church&#39;s claim to embody Christ, Giussani situates the locus of verification in human experience, arguing that a different type of life is born in those who try to live the life of the Church. Why the Church? is a seminal study that will engage both the scholar and the general reader.</p><p>CA</p><h2>The Weekenders: A Novel</h2><p><p>Some people stay all summer long on the idyllic island of Belle Isle, North Carolina.

Were the Reformers correct to insist that the good news of God's gracious and free acceptance of guilty sinners, on the basis of the obedience and atoning sacrifice of Christ, lies at the heart of the gospel? Or are we to accept the 'new perspectives' on Paul's teaching, which have been advocated in recent years by those who have made a fresh study of the relevant historical sources?<br> Since the new perspectives challenge some of the basic features of the traditional Protestant understanding of justification, they require careful study and thoughtful evaluation.

Luce argues that we are on a menacing trajectory brought about by ignorance of what it took to build the West, arrogance towards society's economic losers, and complacency about our system's durability&#x2015;attitudes that have been emerging since the fall of the Berlin Wall. We cannot move forward without a clear diagnosis of what has gone wrong. Unless the West can rekindle an economy that produces gains for the majority of its people, its political liberties may be doomed. The West's faith in history teaches us to take democracy for granted. Reality tells us something troublingly different.</p><p> Combining on-the-ground reporting with intelligent synthesis of the literature and economic analysis, Luce offers a detailed projection of the consequences of the Trump administration, the rise of European populism, and a forward-thinking analysis of what those who believe in enlightenment values must do to defend them from the multiple onslaughts they face in the coming years.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2017:</strong> Why does it feel like things are coming apart in the world? As the U.S. commentator for the <em>Financial Times</em>, Edward Luce is in a good position to observe global trends and answer this question. In <em>The Retreat of Western Liberalism</em>, he points to the rise in populism across nations and the relative economic growth of a few developing countries like China and India as key contributing factors. Of course it&#x2019;s much more complicated than that, and Luce&#x2019;s taut and satisfying book goes a long way in helping us to wrap our heads around what&#x2019;s happening. Think of this as a global <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em>. You may not find every answer you&#x2019;re looking for, but you&#x2019;ll make serious, welcome progress in understanding the questions. <em>--Chris Schluep, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Edward Luce</b> is a graduate from Oxford University in Politics, Philosophy and Economics.

Miller's book arrives at a moment when it appears that part of the Homeland Security apparatus is backpedaling by promising to tone down its tactics, maybe prodded by investigative journalism, maybe by the revelations of NSA leaker Edward Snowden ... <em>Border Patrol</em> is quite possibly the right book at the right time ... "&#x2014;Tony Perry, <em>Los Angeles Times</em></p><p>"At the start of his unsettling and important new book, <em>Border Patrol Nation</em>, Miller observes that these days 'it is common to see the Border Patrol in places&#x2014;such as Erie, Pennsylvania; Rochester, New York; or Forks, Washington&#x2014;where only fifteen years ago it would have seemed far-fetched, if not unfathomable.'&#x201d;&#x2014;Barbara Spindel, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></p><p>"Miller&#x2019;s approach in <em>Border Patrol Nation</em> is to offer a glimpse into the secretive operations of the Border Patrol, reporting with a journalist&#x2019;s objectivity and nose for a good story.

He writes of the people he sees as the victims of the Border Patrol's abrasiveness and also of the cruel deportation policy of the Obama administration that breaks up families ... But the book shows surprising sympathy for many agents who are required by their jobs to be enforcers of a tough system."&#x2014;Tony Perry, <em>Miami Herald</em></p><p>"Miller&#x2019;s approach in <em>Border Patrol Nation</em> is to offer a glimpse into the secretive operations of the Border Patrol, reporting with a journalist&#x2019;s objectivity and nose for a good story. Miller&#x2019;s book is full of facts, and it&#x2019;s clear he&#x2019;s outraged, but he gives voices to people on every side of the issue ...

If you want to learn about the Border Patrol's world, you will find this book informative and startling. I'm not sure the Border Patrol will like all that he has to say. But his is a moral work that wrestles with a huge story. Powerful."&#x2014;Luis Alberto Urrea, author of <em>The Devil's Highway: A True Story</em></p><p>"Journalist Miller tells an alarming story of U.S. Border Patrol and Homeland Security&#x2019;s ever-widening reach into the lives of American citizens and legal immigrants as well as the undocumented. He describes the militarization of the Border Patrol and concurrent dehumanizing of 'unauthorized' persons; American citizens routinely harassed and arrested in Constitution-free zones that extend 100 miles from all borders; the expulsion of a exemplary Border Patrol agent for expressing his Mexican identity in casual conversation; and the Border Patrol&#x2019;s Explorer Academy for children, which, with its lock-step marching, black boots, law-enforcement training, and indoctrination is eerily evocative of fascism and Hitler Youth. Miller reveals the 'complex and industrial world' looming behind the border patrol, spanning 'robotics, engineers, salespeople and detention centers' and the new generation of Explorers. 'It is the world in which we now live,' he states, 'where eradicating border violations is given higher priority than eradicating malnutrition, poverty, homelessness, illiteracy, [and] unemployment.' In addition to readers interested in immigration issues, those concerned about the NSA&#x2019;s privacy violations will likely be even more shocked by the actions of Homeland Security."&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, Starred Review</p><p>"I encourage everyone to read this book and to recommend it to colleagues, friends and family who live far from the border and perhaps don't know yet that they live in Border Patrol Nation ... They will soon enough."&#x2014;Molly Molloy, editor, <em>Frontera List</em></p><p>"Todd Miller's book <em>Border Patrol Nation</em> has some eye opening reporting, especially for those of us who live along the border and think we know the facts of the expanding police state. Well, I didn't know the Border Patrol provided security for the Superbowl. And I was ignorant of their youth groups and the scale of such propaganda work. I don't think anyone can read this book without being alarmed by the growing presence of surveillance, the expense and the apparent acceptance by our fellow citizens of this new national police force. He illustrates how the border increasingly is running right through our living rooms regardless of where we live as the claims of the security state crush any ideas of personal freedom. And like any good book, the reader will argue with some pages and think about others. Miller also captures how the universities are become satanic mills for the growing industry of spying on us for our own good. Who knows, maybe the academy will stop accepting grants from the people who want to build more cages and instead become centers of critical thinking."&#x2014;Charles Bowden, author of <em>Murder City: Ciudad Juarez and the Global Economy's New Killing Fields</em></p><p>"The U.S. needs a reality check about its border with Mexico, and none need it more than the Congress. I wish every member could get a copy of <em>Border Patrol Nation</em>, and see up close the impact of a quarter century of increasing enforcement and militarization. Todd Miller has done an important service for those who make our laws, and the rest of us too, in giving us this reality check. He's told the real story of the border as a place where people live and work, in many ways a unique and beautiful place, but now scarred, as he so eloquently describes, by injustice and even death."--David Bacon, author, <em>The Right to Stay Home: How U.S. Policy Drives Mexican Migration</em></p><p>"In <em>Border Patrol Nation</em>, Todd Miller takes us on a terrifying journey crisscrossing the borders of our nation to find decaying carcasses, loving families ripped apart by deportations and whole swaths of territory now militarized. Miller exposes the underpinnings of this ever-expanding surveillance state&#x2015;military contractors that rake in fat profits and bloated government agencies that keep extending their tentacles while the core of our neighborhoods wither from neglect. Miller reveals the humanity of both the victims and the victimizers, and the inhumanity of the system. A fantastic book."&#x2014;Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Code Pink and author of <em>Drone Warfare: Killing by Remote Control</em></p><p>"<em>Border Patrol Nation</em> takes the reader on a voyage like no other book. From El Paso to Detroit, from reality television to corporate trade shows, from South Carolina to the Dominican Republic, Todd Miller paints a highly original and illuminating picture of the breadth and depth of the U.S. government's boundary and immigrant policing apparatus, and surveillance and social control in the era of 'Homeland Security.' It is a book that frightens and inspires, and one that demands a wide audience. Miller's message is one we ignore at our peril."&#x2014;Joseph Nevins, author of <em>Operation Gatekeeper and Beyond: The War On "Illegals" and the Remaking of the U.S.-Mexico Boundary</em></p><p>&#x201c;Todd Miller provides a tour de force of the ever-growing, metastasizing border enforcement apparatus focused on threats posed by immigrants, drug runners, and nearly non-existent terrorists. From the U.S.-Mexico divide and the U.S.-Canada boundary and many interior areas between, to the Caribbean and the border separating the Dominican Republic and Haiti, reinforced (against Haitians) with assistance from U.S. Border Patrol, Miller highlights the problem of the fetishistic over-use of coercive technology and human resources cum militarization to address what are essentially underlying social problems. Miller renders it all with the vivid human experiences and agency of residents, citizens, government authorities, technocrats, contractors/profiteers, and immigrants and their families.

As consul in 63 BC, he put down the Catilinarian conspiracy; later, he was sent into exile for refusing to join the First Triumvirate.

The Museum brought Rivera to New York six weeks before the show's opening and gave him on-site studio space. There he produced five &#x201c;portable murals&#x201d; --large blocks of frescoed plaster, slaked lime and wood that feature bold images drawn from Mexican subject matter and address themes of revolution and class inequity. After the opening, to great publicity, Rivera added three more murals, now taking on New York subjects through monumental images of the urban working class and the city during the Great Depression. Published in conjunction with an exhibition that brings together key works made for Rivera's 1931 show, this catalogue casts the artist as a highly cosmopolitan figure who traveled between Russia, Mexico and the United States and examines the intersection of artmaking and radical politics in the 1930s. Illustrated with reproductions of each panel as well as related paintings, drawings, prints and documentary photographs, the book's essays investigate the international politics of muralism, Rivera's history with MoMA, the iconography of the portable murals and technical aspects of the artist's working process.<br><b>Diego Rivera</b> (1886-1957) was a central figure in the development of Mexican muralism, an ambitious public art initiative intended to relay Mexico's ideals after the Revolution (1910-1920). A highly cosmopolitan artist, Rivera had spent many years in Europe before returning to Mexico in 1921, and in 1927 he traveled to the Soviet Union where he met Alfred Barr, the soon-to-be founding director of The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Rivera's artistic celebrity benefitted from major commissions in the United States, including murals for the Pacific Stock Exchange, the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, MoMA and the Detroit Institute of Arts. By the 1930s, he enjoyed an unrivaled status at the center of international debates about public art and politics..</p><p>"Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art", at MOMA, revisits the high tide of the artist's American success. The show reunites three of the five frescoes that Rivera created on portable supports of steel-braced cement, in 1931, for what was the museum's second solo exhibition, the first having been devoted to Matisse. It includes two other frescoes that Rivera made in New York at the time, along with studies and preparatory cartoons, documents and technical analyses.

However, it is far more interesting than geometric shapes! Reading this book, children will become aware of the balance of things in nature. They will delight at amazing photographs of butterflies, beetles, leaves and flowers, fruit, sea creatures, and children. This book will show how a person with arms outstretched has fivefold symmetry like a sea star, and if you drew a circle around his or her body in that position, the navel would be at its center.</p><p></p><h2>Santa Cruz 1942: Carrier duel in the South Pacific (Campaign)</h2><p><p>Santa Cruz is the forgotten carrier battle of 1942. Despite myth, the Japanese carrier force was not destroyed at Midway but survived to still prove a threat in the Pacific theater. Nowhere was this clearer than in the battle of Santa Cruz of October 1942. The stalemate on the ground in the Guadalcanal campaign led to the major naval forces of both belligerents becoming inexorably more and more involved in the fighting, each seeking to win the major victory that would open the way for a breakthrough on land as well.</p><p>The US Task Force 61 under the command of Rear Admiral Kinkaid and consisting of the carriers Hornet and Enterprise, as well the battleship South Dakota and a number of cruisers and destroyers, intercepted the Japanese fleet, which boasted four carriers - Shokaku, Zuikaku, Junyo and Zuiho - as well as four battleships and numerous other ships, on 26 October. Though US aircraft managed to damage the Japanese carriers seriously, in turn Hornet was so badly damaged that shed had to be sunk, while Enterprise was hit and needed extensive repairs. Both sides withdrew at the end of the action.</p><p>The Japanese were able to gain a tactical victory at Santa Cruz and came very close to scoring a strategic victory, but they paid a very high price in aircraft and aircrew that prevented them from following up their victory. In terms of their invaluable aircrew, the battle was much more costly than even Midway and had a serious impact on the ability of the Japanese to carry out carrier warfare in a meaningful manner.</p></p><p>Mark E.

But lately things have gotten so bad our pants could spontaneously ignite pretty much any day of the week and nobody would even bat an eye.<br><br> It all started with the return of Galdervatn.<br><br> Or, at least, <i>sort of.</i> I mean, that&#x2019;s definitely when it started, but what we didn&#x2019;t know was that Galdervatn only sort of came back. Which means the Dawn of a New Magical Age hasn&#x2019;t quite arrived the way I thought it had when I was standing on Navy Pier several months ago, watching the city go dark right after defeating my former best friend, Edwin.<br><br> But right now you&#x2019;re probably just wondering how in the world I ended up with my pants engulfed in flames and an angry Gargoyle with a mullet chasing close behind. I wish I could tell you it wasn&#x2019;t my fault, that I wasn&#x2019;t responsible for getting myself into such a predicament. But then I&#x2019;d be lying, and Dwarves don&#x2019;t lie.<br><br> We were in downtown Evanston (a suburb directly north of Chicago) on our first-ever Monster Pacification Mission (MPM).<br><br> According to the Council&#x2019;s guidelines, MPMs have just two simple rules:<br><br> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid violence at all costs (befriending the monster is better than beheading it).<br> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#x2019;t make a scene.<br><br> You already know I broke rule number two. Since, by most people&#x2019;s standards, a pudgy kid running down a street screaming with his pants ablaze in bright flames would constitute something of a &#x201c;scene.&#x201d; And, coincidentally, the vicious Gargoyle flying right behind me certainly meant I was likely to break rule number one as well.<br><br> Turns out that knowing you&#x2019;re a Dwarf doesn&#x2019;t exactly help you avoid <i>failing </i>like one. But we definitely hadn&#x2019;t expected things to go <i>this </i>poorly.<br><br> Maybe if I go back to when we first arrived in downtown Evanston earlier that night to help explain how I got myself into this mess, it won&#x2019;t seem quite so bad? Maybe it&#x2019;ll even seem like we did the best we could and that breaking the only two MPM rules was pretty much inevitable?<br><br> But first I should probably clarify why Monster Pacification Missions were even a thing at all.<br><br> The short version is this: Galdervatn (or &#x201c;Ancient Separate Earth Magic&#x201d; to your average layperson) is coming back and it can&#x2019;t be stopped, we know that. It appears in the form of a colorful vapor, and as more and more of it gradually seeps from the Earth&#x2019;s core back toward the surface, we&#x2019;re seeing an increase of magical-monster sightings across the globe. And also reports of random rolling blackouts; cell phones dying and never coming back to life; stalled cars, construction equipment, and kitchen appliances; and generally a lot of confusion and chaos among humans.<br><br> MPMs are the Council&#x2019;s solution (for now).<br><br> They identify a possible fantastical-monster sighting, then send out a squad of specially trained Dwarves to neutralize the threat to humans&#x2014;either by befriending the creature and bringing it back to the Underground, or, if need be, by destroying the thing entirely. But &#x201c;strange sightings&#x201d; are being reported so frequently lately that the Council was forced to draft a squad of Dwarven kids to assist. Since Lake, Eagan, Ari, Glam, Froggy, and I were nearly done with our training <i>and</i> already battle tested from infiltrating an Elven hideout to rescue my dad, we were the first lucky kids chosen for a mission.<br><br> Which is how we ended up on a commuter train that night headed out to Evanston, where earlier that day several Humans had reported power outages and sightings of a strange flying object downtown.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so quiet,&#x201d; Ari had said as we descended the steps from the train station sometime around midnight.<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, suburbs usually are quiet this late,&#x201d; I said, forgetting yet again that they hadn&#x2019;t spent most of their lives among Humans in the modern world like I had.<br><br> &#x201c;So where was this thing supposedly spotted?&#x201d; Glam asked, her faint mustache bristling with excitement as she flexed her bulging biceps under the streetlights. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to smash it into oblivion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever it is.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Glam!&#x201d; Ari said. &#x201c;We have to try and befriend it first. Rule number one, remember? Besides, fighting monsters in a downtown suburb definitely won&#x2019;t help us with rule two either.&#x201d;<br><br> We all stopped at the bottom of the steps, under the train platform. Our weapons (to be used in case of emergency only) were stashed in two large hockey bags (surprisingly, the perfect size for stowing battle-axes, swords, and other Dwarven armaments) slung over one each of Glam and Lake&#x2019;s shoulders.<br><br> Glam set her bag down and threw her hands up in frustration.<br><br> &#x201c;Who cares if Humans see us fighting a monster!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all going to find out the truth eventually. A lot of them probably already know something weird is going on. So why are we working so hard to hide it from them?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because the Council said it&#x2019;s not the right time,&#x201d; Eagan explained. &#x201c;Besides, do you really think if a bunch of people who&#x2019;ve been living underground for centuries suddenly emerge and tell the world that all the blackouts and strange occurrences lately are not related to solar flares and climate change and government conspiracies, but rather to the impending return of an ancient, mythical, long-lost <i>magical essence</i>, that the collective world of seven billion people will just go, &#x2018;Oh, yeah, okay, cool. Makes sense.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pfft, they&#x2019;ll <i>have to</i> believe it when they eventually see it,&#x201d; Glam muttered.<br><br> &#x201c;Aye, lest it be known so sayeth ye Elders doeth such that magic draws nigh!&#x201d; Lake added.<br><br> &#x201c;Stop it, you guys, we&#x2019;re wasting time,&#x201d; Ari said. &#x201c;The Council&#x2019;s decision was to avoid attention and to let the Humans discover the truth in due course. So that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll do. Which means no <i>smashing </i>unless we have to!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ugh, <i>fine</i>,&#x201d; Glam finally relented. &#x201c;You just don&#x2019;t want to have any fun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>I&#x2019;m with her</i>, the Bloodletter added from the hockey bag at her feet. <i>Let&#x2019;s make this a party while we&#x2019;re all the way out here! I mean, then we can prove wrong everyone who says the suburbs are boring! We&#x2019;ll chop up a monster, destroy some stuff, then still have time to hit Uncle Julio&#x2019;s for all-you-can-eat fajitas!<br></i><br> &#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re not going to chop up anyone or anything,&#x201d; I said, looking down at the hockey bag. &#x201c;I already told you that on the train when you tried to talk me into cleaving that ticket guy in two just to see if METRA line employees are actually real people and not robots.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Talking to your ax again, huh?&#x201d; Glam asked with a smirk.<br><br> I rolled my eyes, but grinned back.<br><br> &#x201c;Guys, let&#x2019;s stay on track!&#x201d; Ari said. &#x201c;Now, according to the police reports, an unidentified gray object was seen flying above downtown Evanston just after sunset. It mostly stayed near the Carlson building on Church Street. Which is just three blocks east of here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hence alloweth thyne party receiveth th&#x2019;re posthaste!&#x201d; Lake said, pointing east dramatically.<br><br> Glam picked up her hockey bag of weapons and we followed Lake down the silent, deserted suburban street toward the heart of downtown Evanston.<br><br> After a few steps, three squirrels charged ferociously at us from the base of a nearby tree.* I sidestepped one of them and Glam quickly booted it like a football. The other two squirrels squeaked in terror and retreated back toward the tree (which was an Amur cork tree, in case you were curious).<br><br> The squirrel Glam kicked recovered quickly and dove into the safety of a bush, screeching what I can only imagine was a long string of squirrel obscenities.<br><br> &#x201c;Geez, will animals <i>ever </i>stop attacking us?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I mean, just yesterday a pigeon nearly ripped my whole ear off.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, in its defense, you do have pretty ears,&#x201d; Glam said.<br><br> I rolled my eyes and grinned. It was normal for Glam to try to flirt with me or comment on how cute I was at least three or four times a day. But at this point, I think it was more of an ongoing joke than anything serious&#x2014;she just liked to make me uncomfortable (had even said I was especially cute when I was embarrassed).<br><br> &#x201c;They definitely won&#x2019;t stop attacking us if we&#x2019;re kicking them around like soccer balls!&#x201d; Ari said, glaring at Glam.<br><br> &#x201c;Was I just supposed to let it bite me?&#x201d; Glam shot back. &#x201c;It probably had rabies.&#x201d;<br><br> Since Ari didn&#x2019;t really have a good reply, she merely sighed.<br><br> As a rare vegetarian Dwarf (in fact, the only one in existence as far as we all knew), Ari had been particularly hard-hit by the ongoing battle between Dwarves and animals. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what hurt her more: the inexplicable nature of animals&#x2019; hatred for Dwarves, or the fact that many of us were being forced to defend ourselves in increasingly aggressive ways. Not that we particularly enjoyed fighting off the attacks&#x2014;but you really don&#x2019;t know fear until you&#x2019;ve woken up to find a whole army of spiders trying to crawl into your head through your nostrils.<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Anyway</i>,&#x201d; Eagan said as we recovered from the squirrel attack and continued walking toward downtown Evanston, &#x201c;the fact that the potential monster was flying helps narrow down the options of what it might be.&#x201d;<br><br> In the months since the night we rescued my dad from the secret Elven lair inside the huge downtown skyscraper formerly known as the Hancock building, we&#x2019;d not only continued our magic and combat training, but had also started learning about all sorts of other things, including Dwarven history, Elven history, and all the different monsters and creatures (there were a lot of them) that once roamed Separate Earth and might someday return with magic. For the most part, the classes were pretty similar to those at my old school, the PEE. Except that there, my Humanities and Math teachers weren&#x2019;t constantly telling me that my life would one day depend on memorizing the Pythagorean theorem or knowing the names of the artists who emerged during the Early Renaissance period.<br><br> Unsurprisingly, Eagan was near the top of the class for most subjects.<br><br> &#x201c;Narrows it down to how many?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Eagan paused, doing some calculations in his head. &#x201c;There are at least one hundred twenty flying magical creatures known to have existed in Separate Earth. And that&#x2019;s only counting the ones documented, so I guess it actually could be even more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, that really narrows it down,&#x201d; Glam said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a start,&#x201d; Eagan said, but he didn&#x2019;t sound very optimistic himself, even for a Dwarf.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, we know more than just that it flies,&#x201d; Ari said, referencing some printed transcripts of 911 calls.** &#x201c;Witnesses also said it was gray. So how many flying gray monsters do we know once existed in Separate Earth?&#x201d;<br><br> We all turned and stared at Eagan expectantly. He threw his hands up.<br><br> &#x201c;Guys, I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a walking monster encyclopedia! You&#x2019;re all in the same Monsterology and Creature Classification class as I am, you know. I don&#x2019;t always have all the answers.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;T&#x2019;couldst be&#x2019;est a Harpy?&#x201d; Lake suggested.<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, Harpies can fly,&#x201d; Ari agreed. &#x201c;And are generally thought to be gray.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, what else?&#x201d; Eagan said. &#x201c;Who can remember more?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a Langsuyar Vampire!&#x201d; Glam said. &#x201c;They supposedly take the form of beautiful women, but how beautiful can they be? They don&#x2019;t even have facial hair! Pfft. I&#x2019;d love to use my fist as a wooden stake and punch a hole right through her ugly torso!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Gross, Glam,&#x201d; Eagan said. &#x201c;But remember rule one: &#x2018;avoid violence at all costs.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I know,&#x201d; Glam said, rolling her eyes.<br><br> <i>It could be a Krystallinsk Wyvern</i>, the Bloodletter suggested (only to me, of course, since I was the only one blessed/cursed with the ability to hear it). <i>Ooh! I hope it is! For eons, I&#x2019;ve been longing to feel my blade once again slice through their supposedly impervious diamond-encrusted skin! After it&#x2019;s all over, I&#x2019;ll even tell you how to make a Wyvern-skin coat! They used to be quite popular back in Separate Earth, you know. Only the most glamorous people had them.</i><br><br> Next, Ari and Lake each suggested a different hybrid: possibly a Griffin, or maybe a Chimera, respectively.<br><br> As we neared the city center, we passed a homeless guy slouched in an alley. I realized he must have heard a good portion of our conversation, because he looked at us like we were walking, talking toasters.<br><br> Downtown Evanston was made up mostly of modern, sleek, glass buildings, separated by a few gray stone relics from the early twentieth century. That night, the area was deserted, aside from that homeless guy, and a few cars cruising past on the mostly empty streets.<br><br> Our eyes searched the night sky, hazy and orange from the glowing reflections of the nearby streetlights. We collectively looked for signs of a Griffin, Chimera, Krystallinsk Wyvern, Langsuyar Vampire, Harpy, or any other yet-to-be-mentioned monster. But nothing seemed out of the ordinary.<br><br> The first sighting had been reported just over four hours ago. After that, a few more trickled in until just after sunset according to our copy of the Evanston Police Department report log. There was no reason to suspect the monster had suddenly vanished. Unless it was one of the few fantastical beasts that could list &#x201c;spontaneous disappearing&#x201d; among its powers.<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe it was a Kolossal Dagsl�nda?&#x201d; Eagan suggested, apparently thinking the same thing. &#x201c;They supposedly have a life span that is measured by the hour. So maybe it showed up, freaked out some humans, laid a hatchling somewhere, and then died? Perhaps we need to be looking around for a Dagsl�nda hatchling instead?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Froggy said calmly.<br><br> We all spun and stared at him.<br><br> It was often easy to forget he was with us. Even now, after being reunited with his dad (who was also our combat instructor, Buck) and making more friends than he&#x2019;d ever had at the PEE, he still rarely spoke. In fact, I sort of figured he sometimes didn&#x2019;t even listen to our conversations at all since his ears were often plugged with a pair of earbuds connected to an ancient MP3 player.<br><br> &#x201c;What do you mean, <i>no</i>?&#x201d; Eagan asked.<br><br> &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a Kolossal Dagsl�nda,&#x201d; Froggy said. &#x201c;It was a Gargoyle.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What makes you so sure?&#x201d; Ari asked.<br><br> That&#x2019;s when Froggy calmly pointed up toward the roof of an old gray building across the street. Perched on the ledge was a dark gray beast with gnarled wings and glowing red eyes that peered down at us in a decidedly predatory fashion. The creature opened its mouth and let out an anguished shriek before unfurling its massive wings and leaping off the roof.<br><br> The demonic red eyes seemed to grow bigger by the second as they soared right toward us.<br> &nbsp;<br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br> *In case you forgot, the return of magic also led to the reemergence of a savage, inexplicable hatred of Dwarves by pretty much all animals.

While at the Herisau sanitarium, instead of writing, Walser practiced another favorite activity: walking. Starting in 1936, Carl Seelig, Walser&#x2019;s friend and literary executor, visited and accompanied him on these walks, meticulously recording their conversations. As they strolled, Walser told stories, shared his daily experiences of the sanatorium, and expressed his opinions about books and art, writing and history. When Seelig asked why he no longer wrote, Walser famously replied: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here to write, I&#x2019;m here to be mad.&#x201d; Filled with lively anecdotes and details, <em>Walks with Walser</em> offers the fullest available account of this wonderful writer&#x2019;s inner and outer life.</p><p><p>Carl Seelig (1894&#x2013;1962) was a Swiss editor and writer and Robert Walser&#x2019;s friend, guardian, and literary executor. He was a selfless supporter of countless other writers, and was also Albert Einstein&#x2019;s first biographer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anne Posten</strong> is a literary translator based in New York.</p>&#x201c;[Carl Seelig's] personal, firsthand account is the closest we will ever have to a Walser memoir. The questions he poses to Walser, regarding his personal and professional history and his literary and political opinions, seem like those of an oral historian, and Walser, trusting his companion, answers with presence of mind, inflecting the conversation with his characteristic humor and unusual observations.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sarah Cowan, <em>Bookforum</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A]n invaluable text for any serious reader of Walser...&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Literary Hub</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;To use a word much favoured by Walser himself, it&#x2019;s delightful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dorian Stuber, <em>Numero Cinq</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Now, with its translation by Anne Posten, English-language readers can witness, as if in real time, the blossoming of his friendship with the great Swiss author, a bond that would lead to a lifelong effort to keep Walser&#x2019;s name before the public.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael LaPointe, <em>TSL</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;After a nervous breakdown in 1929, Walser spent the remaining 27 years of his life in mental asylums, going from outer exile to inner exile. Walking replaced writing for Walser, and from 1936 onward his friend Carl Seelig recorded their conversations while they walked in Switzerland. It&#x2019;s an extraordinary book that prompted me to found my first museum in 1992: a migratory Robert Walser museum on the theme of the periphery.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hans-Ulrich Obrist, <em>Vulture</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;That Walser is not today among the forgotten writers we owe primarily to the fact that Carl Seelig took up his cause. Without Seelig&#x2019;s accounts of the walks he took with Walser, without his preliminary work on the biography, without the selections from the work he published and the lengths he went to in securing the Nachlass&#x2015;the writer&#x2019;s millions of illegible ciphers&#x2015;Walser&#x2019;s rehabilitation could never have taken place, and his memory would in all probability have faded into oblivion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>W. G. Sebald</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Seelig kindly visited Walser and started keeping a record of his opinions, creating over the course of time an indispensable document for all those who love Walser&#x2019;s surprising prose, which, silent as snowfall, cries out from the nothingness. Walser&#x2015;as can be observed in Seelig&#x2019;s book&#x2015;lectured on beer and twilight.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Enrique Vila-Matas</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Walks with Walser</em> is filled with Walser&#x2019;s philosophy about leading a modest life, finding beauty in mundane things, and getting by with less.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Moyra Davey</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Robert Walser, who spent much of his adult life in Swiss mental hospitals, is now revered for his prose miniatures and his bizarre and haunting novel, <em>Jakob von Gunten,</em> set in a training school for servants. These reminiscences, by his literary executor, preserve Walser's conversation, especially about writers and writing, as well as Seelig's memories of his friend trudging along like &nbsp;'a weary Sherpa' or suddenly calling for 'beer and twilight.'&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Washington Post</em></strong></p><h2>The New Atlantis</h2><p>Originally published in Latin as Nova Atlantis in 1624, this is an unabridged edition.</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world.

And in a time when slavery is still practiced in the colonies, there is but one peculiar clue to the identity of this group: The robbers are all black men. <br><br>The blind judge Sir John Fielding is on the case to ensure that the guilty are punished and that no hasty conclusions are made. But when Sir John takes a bullet to the shoulder, his young prot�g�, Jeremy Proctor, must lead this most delicate investigation under his bedridden counsel.

When a crime spree in a well-to-do neighborhood not far from Sir John's home turns from robbery to murder, and witnesses identify the perpetrators as black men, the focus shifts from police work to prejudice. When the criminals are ultimately revealed to be white men in blackface, Jeremy and Sir John must look deeper into the hearts and minds of their neighbors to discover the real motive for the attacks and cast off their own biases before solving the crime. Alexander draws an accurate picture of racial hypocrisy in an era when slavery, though banned in England, was permitted in its colonies. He gets all the period details right, and his two sleuths get more interesting with every new outing in this historical series. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Bruce Alexander</b> is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and nonfiction.

In this sequence of reflective and critical studies, Samuel Moyn engages with some of the leading interpreters of human rights, thinkers who have been creating a field from scratch without due reflection on the local and temporal contexts of the stories they are telling.</p><p>Having staked out his owns claims about the postwar origins of human rights discourse in his acclaimed <i>Last Utopia</i>, Moyn, in this volume, takes issue with rival conceptions&#x2014;including, especially, those that underlie justifications of humanitarian intervention.</p></p><p><b>Samuel Moyn</b> is professor of law and history at Harvard University. He is the author of <i>The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History</i>, and <i>Christian Human Rights</i> (2015), among other books, as well as editor of the journal <i>Humanity</i>. He also writes regularly for <i>Foreign Affairs</i> and <i>The Nation</i>.&#x201c;An intensely readable journey ... Moyn reminds us that the idea of human rights did not begin with the Second World War and is not an American invention; that individual rights and human dignity are not the same thing; that torture is a relatively recent taboo; that humanitarian intervention (the use of military force to &#x2018;civilise&#x2019;) offers certain dangers; and that newly arrived ideas of international criminal justice and courts will not offer an easy salvation. Moyn&#x2019;s impulses are critical yet he recognises what he calls the &#x2018;global radiance&#x2019; of human rights in our times. There have been failures but also successes, so he seeks a &#x2018;reinvention&#x2019; rather than a replacement. If human rights are to make a practical difference, to be more than an &#x2018;ornament on a tragic world which they do not transform&#x2019;, he wants them to be able to mobilise people, to be less centred on judges and more attentive to real economic and social needs. At a time of growing inequality, within and across borders, the last point will surely resonate, along with the broader underlying message: that the ideas underpinning modern human rights have become a fundamental part of our political culture, and that we ignore history at our peril.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Phillippe Sands, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A brilliant scholar, and in <i>Human Rights and the Uses of History</i> he shows his intellectual heft.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;B�cquer Segu�n, <i>Jacobin</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Tidy, coherent, and invigorating ... Moyn is undoubtedly correct to assert that ignoring the dark side of human rights ideology is both irresponsible and dangerous.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Ardevan Yaghoubi, <i>Oxonian Review</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;There is a struggle for the soul of the human rights movement, and it is being waged in large part through the proxy of genealogy ... Samuel Moyn ... is the most influential of the revisionists.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Philip Alston, <i>Harvard Law Review</i></b></p><h2>Secret Song (Song Novels)</h2><p>First published in 1991, this is the final novel in the medieval Song Series by the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author.</p><p><b>Catherine Coulter</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the FBI Thrillers featuring husband and wife team Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock.

She lives in Sausalito, California.Worn-out plot elements make for an enervated conclusion to Coulter's ( Earth Song ) Song trilogy, set in the 13th century. Damon Le Mark's niece Daria de Fortescue is kidnapped on the way to her wedding: the kidnapper, Edmond of Clare, demands her dowry or he will rape her. Damon employs Roland de Tournay to recover the maid--provided she still is one. If not, says Damon to the rescuer, you can kill her. Roland poses as a priest to gain entrance to Clare's castle. Daria knocks Edmond out cold when he tries to ravish her, and Roland smuggles her out. Distrusting the unscrupulous Damon's motives, Roland decides to stash the young woman in Wales for temporary safekeeping but falls ill en route. Daria's ministrations include climbing into bed with her delirious protector, and she finds herself pregnant by a man who denies he's the father. Seeking assistance against Edmond, who is pursuing him, Roland approaches the king and queen of England; they take pity on Daria and urge Roland to marry her, blithely trusting that the reluctant bride and sulky groom will muddle their way to marital bliss--as, of course, they do. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crossed Over: A Murder, A Memoir</h2><p>The novelist Beverly Lowry was mourning her son&#x2019;s death in a hit-and-run accident when she came across a newspaper story about Karla Faye Tucker, the infamous Houston murderer who was then on death row. The article captured Tucker&#x2019;s innocent beauty, the stunning brutality of her crimes &#x2014; committed with a pickaxe &#x2014; and the stories of her spiritual awakening on death row. Struck by these apparent contradictions, Lowry found herself inexplicably drawn to Tucker, who some ten years later would become the first woman to be executed in Texas since 1863.<br><br>Lowry eventually began to visit Tucker in prison, and over the course of several years she listened to the tragic story of her life before the murders and, in turn, told Karla Faye about her own life and the life and death of her son Peter. <i>Crossed Over</i> is a memoir of this time, a moving account of an unlikely but profound and genuine friendship created in the confines of a visiting room on death row. Now with a new foreword that recounts Tucker&#x2019;s last days and Lowry&#x2019;s experiences at her execution, <b>Crossed Over</b> is also an intimate portrait of a life gone tragically awry and then redeemed behind bars.</p><p>&#x201c;A tremendous literary achievement....

In an illuminating new interpretation, Paramahansa Yogananda, author of <i>Autobiography of a Yogi,</i> reveals the mystical essence of this enigmatic masterpiece, bringing to light the deeper truth and beauty behind its veil of metaphor. Commonly thought to be a celebration of wine and other worldly pleasures, these lyrical Persian quatrains find their true voice when read as a hymn to the transcendent joys of Spirit. <p>This beautifully illustrated edition of <i>Wine of the Mystic</i> introduces for the first time in book form Paramahansa Yogananda's complete commentaries on an enduring treasure of world literature. Yogananda said: "One day as I was deeply concentrated on the pages of Omar Khayyam's <i>Rubaiyat,</i> I suddenly beheld the walls of its outer meanings crumble away, and the vast inner fortress of golden spiritual treasures stood open to my gaze. Ever since, I have admired the beauty of the previously invisible castle of inner wisdom in the <i>Rubaiyat.</i> I have felt that this dream-castle of truth, which can be seen by any penetrating eye, would be a haven for many shelter-seeking souls invaded by enemy armies of ignorance. Profound spiritual treatises by some mysterious divine law do not disappear from the earth even after centuries of misunderstanding, as in the case of the <i>Rubaiyat.</i> Not even in Persia is all of Omar Khayyam's deep philosophy understood in its entirety, as I have tried to present it."</p><p>Winner of the 1995 Benjamin Franklin Award for Best Book in the Field of Religion, this edition features 50 beautiful original color illustrations and includes Persian text and spiritual commentary to each quatrain.</p></p><p>Born in India on January 5, 1893, Paramahansa Yogananda devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Sri Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalni Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.<i>A glowing spiritual interpretation�&#x20ac;�Highly recommended.</i> --- Library Journal<br><br><i>All seekers will appreciate Yogananda's clear discussion on such topics as karma, reincarnation, destiny and free will, maya, meditation, perfecting love, life's problems, true security, the cosmic drama, and more.

In 1940 Darrow returns to the world he once renounced, but faced with many unforeseen temptations he fails to control his psychic, most glamorous powers.

From Genesis to Revelation, you'll get the dirt on the dastardly deeds perpetrated by Bible characters ranging from the truly villainous to the temporarily wayward. Weaving together gospel truth humor, Dennis Gaunt shows that you can't have a great story without a great bad guy and that by studying and knowing the mistakes biblical bad guys made, we can avoid falling into similar perilous traps. This entertaining and inspiring book also wraps up each chapter with thoughtful questions that invite you to ponder and apply in your own life the spiritual lessons from these fascinating stories.</p></p><p>In ancient times, when Dennis Gaunt was a seminary student, his teachers would often extol the virtues of the great heroes of the Bible, like Abraham, Moses, or Peter. Meanwhile, Dennis found himself drawn to the bad guys; the Goliaths, the Pharaohs, and the Pharisees of the world. He always felt the lessons the bad guys had to teach us, about what not to do, were every bit as important as the lessons from the good guys. The result has been a lifelong study of the bad guys, the guys who did things wrong, so that we can learn to do them right.</p><h2>The Unbreakable Code (The Book Scavenger series, 2)</h2><p>Mr. Quisling is definitely up to something mysterious, and Emily and James are on high alert.

She understands and exploits the unique strengths of her medium: the ability to viscerally connect with an audience.&#x201d; <i>The Economist</i><br><br>Experimental Korean American theatre artist Young Jean Lee has been called one of the best experimental playwrights in America&#x201d; (<i>Time Out New York</i>). This volume contains two of her recent works:<br><br>In <i>The Shipment</i>, Lee provides a provocative look at African-American identity in our not-yet post-racial society.

But as we consider the current refugee crisis, acclaimed historian Peter Gatrell reminds us that the history of Europe has always been one of people on the move.<br><br> The end of World War II left Europe in a state of confusion with many Europeans virtually stateless. Later, as former colonial states gained national independence, colonists and their supporters migrated to often-unwelcoming metropoles. The collapse of communism in 1989 marked another fundamental turning point. <br><br> Gatrell places migration at the center of post-war European history, and the aspirations of migrants themselves at the center of the story of migration. This is an urgent history that will reshape our understanding of modern Europe.<br><br></p><p><b>Peter Gatrell</b> is a renowned historian of modern migration and a professor of economic history at the University of Manchester. He is the author of six previous books on migration history and modern European history. He lives in Manchester, England."In a superb new study, <i>The Unsettling of Europe</i>, Peter Gatrell notes that, in the postwar era, Irish immigration to England 'steadily began to yield in significance to migration from other parts of the world.'"&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New Yorker</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[T]his book ... provides an overview and essential starting point for anyone seeking to understand migration pressures in Europe and, by extension to other places, from Bangladesh to Texas."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Journal of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Gatrell's eye for detail and sensitivity make this a compelling account that challenges the "us" and "them" framing into which much discussion of migration is forced. Its great strength is that it treats the emotional and cultural aspects of the subject with as much respect as the historical facts and figures."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>The Guardian</b></i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Unsettling of Europe</i> is a welcome contribution to this debate, because it does what so few other studies do: focuses clearly on the forces driving migration, and on the effects of migration on those who are uprooted."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Spiked</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Simply put, <i>The Unsettling of Europe</i> not only is a fundamental book for those studying contemporary European history and politics, but it also places the postcolonial world inside of European history in a way that does not treat migrants as 'Other,' and serves as a clarion call for historians that follow."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>EuropeNow Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Unsettling of Europe </i>is a definitive book in which Peter Gatrell, a historian of population movement at the University of Manchester, proves that "what we used to have" is a chimerical idea... [a] clearly written and essential history."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>The Times</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Gatrell's detailed but lucid and accessible treatment balances close analysis of shifting policies with vivid, sympathetic sketches of migrants negotiating perilous border crossings and struggling to fit in."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i></i></b><br><br>undefined&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>The Spectator</b></i></i></b><br><br>"One of the greatest strengths of the book is Gatrell's consistent attention to the voices of migrants themselves... Gatrell's closely focused studies help us to see this set of issues as illuminating some much wider questions about the way we live now."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New Statesman</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Peter Gatrell has produced a tour de force. With great sensitivity he follows the experiences of migrants as they encounter an often hostile and discriminatory environment in their new homes in Europe. This important and timely work on one of the most challenging issues in modern Europe deserves to be widely read."&#x2015;<b>Ian Kershaw</b>, <b><i><b>author of <i>The Global Age: Europe, 1950-2017</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Walter the Baker (The World of Eric Carle)</h2><p><b>Pretzels give pastries some competition in this delicious board book edition of a classic favorite from the author of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i>. </b><br><br>Walter the Baker is famous for his breads, rolls, cookies, tarts, and pies.

But apart from having an important role in the web of life, nettles are an incredibly useful plant to mankind. They have been put to myriad uses by our ancestors, and many of these are still valid today. Already stinging nettle products are growing in popularity in the field of alternative medicine, as their wide range of health benefits becomes better known. This unique book explores the diverse uses of this fascinating plant - in the garden and the kitchen, for their medical and fibrous properties and so on. It is packed with practical suggestions, as well as a guide to the botany of stinging nettles, and how to collect and store them. For example, you will discover how to use nettles to: make a liquid plant fertiliser brew an unusual beer make a dandruff treatment protect beehives flavour an omelette make friendship bracelets repel flies naturally make green or yellow fabric dyes keep yourself warm in the winter and much more ... The many health benefits of taking nettles in various forms include relief from: hay fever and other allergies; acne and other skin conditions; arthritis and rheumatism; asthma; stress; high blood pressure; depression; enlarged prostate gland. The book also features Digital Nettle Art!</p><p>I expect your first question is &#x2018;Are there really that many uses for stinging nettles?&#x2019; The answer most definitely is yes &#x2013; and more besides, depending on how you categorise them. <p>Your second question might be &#x2018;Why on earth write about the uses of stinging nettles?&#x2019; Well I have two very good reasons: the first is that from a practical point of view these are uses that you may be able to put to your benefit; the second is that stinging nettles are a good example of the valuable natural resources that surround us, yet are often ignored. </p><p>We are becoming aware that disappearing rainforests contain many plants that can be of great use to mankind &#x2013; in combating disease for example &#x2013; and let&#x2019;s hope we are realising this before it is too late. But in our own back yards we also have many useful plants, most of which we think of as weeds and destroy. With our increasingly disposable and environment-damaging lifestyles it is important to value the resources that nature has given us. </p><p>Everything has its place in nature, and, even if you don&#x2019;t end up enjoying a nettle omelette, or gargling nettle juice to ease your sore throat, I hope you will think of nettles with a little more affection and respect after reading this book. Stinging nettles, like wasps, are often thought of as unnecessary evils of the natural world, but they are vital elements of the web of life. If we look into the past we see that our ancestors indeed made much use of stinging nettles (and many other wild plants too) and most of these uses are just as valid today. </p><p>Above all, nettles are extremely good for us. They are packed with vitamins, minerals and fibre, and have many healing properties.</p></p><h2>The Sea Is Full of Stars (Well World)</h2><p>This exciting, action-packed novel marks Jack Chalker's triumphant return to his celebrated multivolume saga: The Well World. The Sea Is Full of Stars explores an unknown interstellar civilization, stars an all-new cast of characters, and reveals fresh secrets. But of course, The Well remains . . .<br><br>After three passengers--Ming, Ari, and Angel--embark on an elite starship journey into the Realm, they unwittingly become ensnared in one man's bloodthirsty vendetta that will alter their very beings. That man is Jeremiah Wong Kincaid. He vows to destroy Josich Conqueror Hadun, the evil genius who has wreaked unspeakable havoc throughout the universe. It is an obsession that will take him to lands of demons and strange races--and into a deadly new cyberworld where humans are mere pawns of the godlike computers they have created. <br><br>But it is only after Kincaid and his unwitting fellow travelers enter Well World and discover the water hexes that he confronts the mad tyrant--and learns their universe is threatened by something far, far worse . . .</p><p>Jack L. Chalker was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on December 17, 1944. While still in high school, he began writing for the amateur science fiction press, and in 1960 he launched the Hugo-nominated amateur magazine Mirage. A year later he founded Mirage Press, which grew into a major specialty publisher of nonfiction and reference books on science fiction and fantasy.<br><br>His first novel, A Jungle of Stars, was published in 1976, and he became a full-time novelist two years later with the major popular success of Midnight at the Well of Souls. Chalker is an active conservationist and enjoys traveling, consumer electronics, and computers. He is also a noted speaker on science fiction and fantasy at numerous colleges and universities. He is a passionate lover of steamboats, in particular ferryboats, and has ridden more than three hundred ferries in the United States and elsewhere.Asswam Junction, Near the Crab Nebula<br> &nbsp;<br> MONSTERS ARE NOT ALWAYS SO EASY TO SPOT, AND WHEN they walk among you they often do so with a smile, and when they become what they are underneath the glare, you don&#x2019;t really know what&#x2019;s happened. And when a monster has friends and followers and sometimes even worshipers, it can become far more than a single dark blot of evil on the fabric of time; then it has the capacity to suddenly rear off and carry even the most innocent straight to Hell, or to do even worse and take your own existence and extend Hell to that as well. This is a story of monsters and maidens and the walking dead. The fact that it begins on a starship only drives home the point . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> He had the smell of death and the look of the grave in him. Everyone could sense it, almost as if he were somehow broadcasting the cold chill that those of any race who encountered him instantly felt.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d been handsome once, but long ago. Now his face was badly weathered, wrinkled, and pockmarked, and there was a scar on one cheek that didn&#x2019;t look to be the result of a slip in some friendly fencing match. His eyes were deep, sunken, cold, and empty, his hair thick but silver, worn long and looking something like a mane.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was eerie when he walked past the small group of passengers in the waiting lounge; they were of perhaps a half-dozen races, some inscrutable to others and tending to hold far different views of the universe and all that was in it, yet when he passed, every one of them reacted, some turning to look, some turning away, and some edging back as if the mere touch of his garment would bring instant death.<br> &nbsp;<br> A Rithian watched him walk down the hall toward the vendor hall, its snakelike head and burning orange eyes almost hypnotized by the figure now going farther away. &#x201c;I had not believed that he could draw so much more of the nether regions than he already had long ago,&#x201d; it muttered, almost to itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Terran woman shook off a final chill, turned and looked at the creature who&#x2019;d made the comment. &#x201c;You know him?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I knew him,&#x201d; the Rithian answered, finally bringing its face back down to normal by distending its long serpentine neck and looking over at the woman instead. &#x201c;At least, I have seen him before, long ago, and I know who he is. I am surprised that you do not, he being of your kind. He is certainly a legend, and, someday, he will be a part of your mythology I suspect. I hope he is not on our liner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook her head, trying to get a grip on herself. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think I ever felt anyone so&#x2014;so evil.&#x201d; She actually started to say &#x201c;inhuman&#x201d; but realized how inappropriate that would be in present company.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Evil? Perhaps. It is impossible to know what he has become inside, and to what he&#x2019;s sold his soul. But he is not precisely evil. In fact, he seeks an evil, and until he finds it and faces it and either kills it or it kills him, he cannot rest or ever find peace. He is Jeremiah Wong Kincaid. Does that name mean nothing to you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She thought hard. &#x201c;Should it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then what about the scouring of Magan Thune?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was history to her, ancient history from the time of her parents at least, and thus the kind of thing you didn&#x2019;t tend to dwell on later in life unless you liked to wallow in the sick and violent history of humanity. She only vaguely recalled it even now. &#x201c;Something about igniting the atmosphere of a planet, wasn&#x2019;t it? So long ago . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The atmosphere of a planet with six billion souls upon it, yes. Six billion souls who had been infected with a most horrible parasite by a megalomaniac would-be conqueror of the Realm, Josich the Emperor Hadun. A Ghoma, you might recall. A creature of the water, really. He&#x2019;d found a way, the only known way, to conquer whole worlds composed of various races alien to him, and to even control environments he could not himself exist in without an environment suit. Tiny little quasiorganic machines, like viruses, transmitted like viruses as well, who could remake and tailor themselves for any bioorganism, any place, anywhere, and turn whole populations into slaves. There was no way to cure them; the things were more communicable than air and water. Isolate them, and they killed the hosts, horribly. Let them go, and a whole planet would be devoted to infecting everyone and everything else. It was the greatest horror our common histories ever produced.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She shivered, remembering now why she&#x2019;d not liked that kind of history. &#x201c;And this Kincaid&#x2014;he was a part of this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A liner was intercepted and boarded. Everyone on it was infected. It was only because of security systems that it only reached Magan Thune before being discovered and dealt with. There are such horrible distances in space for even messages and warnings to cover, and you cannot station naval ships with great firepower at every one. We&#x2014;all our races&#x2014;breed a bit too much for that. Kincaid was commander of a small frigate, an escort naval vessel used in frontier areas. He&#x2019;d come to the sector to meet his mate and children, and have some leave on some resort world. He wasn&#x2019;t supposed to come to Magan Thune at all, but went to check when the liner was late making its next port of call.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She was suddenly appalled. &#x201c;He was the one who ignited the atmosphere?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. He was spared that. Much too junior for such a thing. That took a task force. All he could do, upon discovering what was taking place, was to deal with any spacefaring craft, to ensure none got away. That, of course, included the liner . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat down, not wanting to think about it anymore but forced to do so anyway by the sheer magnitude of the tragedy the Rithian was relating and the knowledge that it was true.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d had to wipe out his whole family. Almost certainly he&#x2019;d done more than give the order. He would have been human; he couldn&#x2019;t have allowed anyone else to do it for him while he watched.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only months after, they figured out how it all worked,&#x201d; the Rithian continued. &#x201c;They discovered the shifting band of frequencies by which the things communicated with each other, with others in other bodies, and with the command. Block them, work out the basics of what had to be a fairly simple code to be so universal and require so little bandwidth, and then order them to turn themselves off after restoring normalcy to their hosts. There were recriminations, trials, insistence on affixing blame. Nobody blows up a liner, let alone a planet, without the highest orders, but the public wanted heads. They second-guessed from screeching journalism, demanded to know why containment wasn&#x2019;t an option, and so on. Never mind that one major industry of Magan Thune was the construction of deep space engines. That&#x2019;s why the Conqueror had wanted it. And a hundred planets within days of there with possibly half a trillion souls.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She tried to put the vision out of her mind. Thank God she never had to make those kind of choices! &#x201c;And he&#x2019;s been like that ever since?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That and more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I wouldn&#x2019;t have killed myself after that,&#x201d; she mused.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He might have,&#x201d; the Rithian responded, &#x201c;and some say he all but did anyway. You saw him, felt him, as did I, and I do not believe we have a great deal physiologically in common, and perhaps culturally even less. There are things that are universal. But he will not die. He will not permit himself to die. I believe he has been through a rejuve or two. He has unfinished business. He cannot leave until it is completed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Huh? What&#x2014;What kind of business could he still have?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They never caught Josich the Emperor Hadun, you know. He is deposed for a great amount of time, and some say he is dead, although if Kincaid is not dead, then neither is Josich. One will not go without the other. Many say instead that Josich has become the emperor of the criminal underground, and that he is the source of much of the evil on countless worlds even now. Sixty years and Kincaid still hunts. That is why I hope he is not going on the same ship as we. If Kincaid could but guarantee the death of Josich, he would willingly take all of us with him. I would prefer he walk a different path than myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Kincaid was already returning to the departure lounge, and it was clear this was going to be an interesting trip.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tale of the haunted man involved what the Rithian had called a &#x201c;liner,&#x201d; but even in those days that designation was for the rich and powerful only. Transport, then and now, was more complex than that for most travelers, and even now it was someone very rare who&#x2019;d been off his or her own native world, and even fewer who had ever left their solar system. Travel was expensive, often long, and, in most people&#x2019;s cases, unnecessary. And with more than forty races in the Realm and perhaps two dozen others that interacted with it, it wasn&#x2019;t all that easy to support them in ecofriendly quarters for the weeks or months a trip might involve. Even with such as the Rithians and Terrans, who comfortably breathed each other&#x2019;s air and could in fact eat each other&#x2019;s foods, there were sufficient dramatic differences in their physical requirements to make things very complex.<br> &nbsp;<br> The money in deep space travel was where it had been in ocean travel and river travel and rail travel in ancient times. The money was in freight. The money was always in freight. That was why ships that went between the stars resembled less the fabled passenger liners of oceanic days than trains, with powerful engine modules and an elaborate bridge that could oversee the largely automated operation, and then, forward of this, were coupled the mods of freight and then the passenger modules designed for various life-form requirements. Robotics and a central life-support computer catered to them; for a considerable fee one could have a real live concierge assigned, but this was mostly for status.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics</h2><p>One of the most beloved country music stars of all time gives us the first collection of her lyrics and, in her own words, tells the stories that inspired her most popular songs, such as "Coal Miner's Daughter," "Don't Come Home A' Drinkin'," and, of course, "I'm a Honky Tonk Girl."<br> <br> Loretta Lynn's rags-to-riches story--from her hardscrabble childhood in Butcher Holler, Kentucky, through her marriage to Oliver "Doolittle" Lynn when she was thirteen, to her dramatic rise to the top of the charts--has resonated with countless fans throughout her more than fifty-year career. Now, the anecdotes she shares here give us deeper insight into her life, her collaborations, her influences, and how she pushed the boundaries of country music by discussing issues important to working-class women, even when they were considered taboo. Readers will also get a rare look at the singer's handwritten lyrics and at personal photographs from her childhood, of her family, and of her performing life. <i>Honky Tonk Girl: A Life in Lyrics </i>is one more way for Lynn's fans--those who already love her and those who soon will--to know the heart and mind of this remarkable woman.</p><p>LORETTA LYNN was the first woman to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. She has had sixteen number-one singles, fifteen number-one albums, and countless other hit records."The Story of My Life"<br>I wrote the song "The Story of My Life" just because I was born in old Kentucky in them hills where folks are lucky!<br><br>I wrote this song in about 1959. It was one of my first ones. Doo and I'd just started, and I was learning how to write songs. For me, I could and can only write what I've lived. I recorded this song on my very first session on Zero Records and forgot about it! Patsy, on the other hand, didn't. I told ya'll she is my biggest fan. She loved<br><br>it, drug it out, and wrote a couple of new verses to it, played it for Jack White, and the rest is history. Now I can forget about this song again (laughing)!<br><b>He's the story of my life,<br><br>Listen close and I'll tell ya twice.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey.<br>I was born in old Kentucky<br><br>In them hills where folks are lucky<br><br>And it's paradise to me.<br><br>Well, I got a feller right over the hill<br><br>If he asks me to marry well I know <br><br>I will.<br>He asked me to marry, got kids of four<br><br>And I'm tellin' you I don't want no more.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey.<br>Doo got me a guitar, I wrote me a song<br><br>Moved to Nashville and it wasn't long<br><br>Till I was on the Grand Ole Opry.<br>We bought us a mansion on the hill<br><br>Livin' big like we were big deals<br><br>Scarlett O'Hara, Gone <i>With the Wind</i><br>I was pregnant again.<br><br>Oh gee, oh Lord I swear<br><br>The babies are comin' in pairs.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey.<br><br>Well, some big shot from Hollywood<br><br>Thought a movie about my life would be good<br><br>It was a big hit, made a big splash<br><br>What I wanna know is what happened to the cash.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey.<br>Now me and Doo married forty-eight years<br><br>Six kids later, a lot of laughter and tears.<br><br>I have to say that I've been blessed<br><br>Not bad for this old Kentucky girl I guess.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey.<br>Well, here's the story of my life,<br><br>Listen and I'll tell it twice.<br><br>Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey . . .</b><br>Wilburns<br><br>If it wasn't for Teddy and Doyle Wilburn, I don't know if I would have gotten to be as successful as I became in country music.<br><br>I met Doyle for the first time in 1960. I had just recorded my record "Honky Tonk Girl" on Zero label. We met at a DJ convention out west. I gave Doyle my record, and he gave me his address and told me if me and my husband ever got to Nashville we should let him know. As soon as I got home, I started writing the Wilburns letters. And they always wrote me back. I told them I really wanted to get my foot in the door in the music business. So Doyle and Teddy sent me out six songs and said to learn them and if I ever came to Nashville, Tennessee, they would demo me singing them. That was all we needed to hear! Me and Doo loaded our oldest off to Doo's mom and daddy, and Ernest and Cissie went to my mommy's house in Indiana . . . then we drove straight to the Wilburn Brothers' office. Lord, them boys were surprised to see us.<br><br>The Wilburns were a big family, and the whole family worked there. They took me and Doo in, found us a place to stay, fed us, gave us money, and treated us like their family.<br><br>Teddy and Doyle did what they said they would do. I learned all the songs they sent me, and they cut my first demos. The boys and I became close, like sister and brothers. Teddy and Doyle were already pretty big stars in country music and really good businessmen. They started working with me, teaching me how to sing and how to think about writing songs so I could become a better songwriter. Heck, Teddy even bought me my first pair of high heels. He said that I came to Nashville looking like Annie Oakley's lost sister! I put on those high heels, and Teddy made me walk up and down the hallway at his office until I had blisters.<br><br>I wrote with both Teddy and Doyle. I had never written with anyone be-fore, so it was like stepping into a whole new world. I learned so much from them. The boys said they were learning from me, too. Teddy and I spent the most time together, since he was the more musical of the two. Doyle was more of the manager type, at least when it came to working with me.<br><br>Both always encouraged me to write my own songs. They also got me signed to Decca Records, and they asked Owen Bradley to produce me. Later, the boys got their own TV show and asked me to be the girl singer on the show. Throughout the sixties and early seventies, they became my partners in songwriting, my publishers, and my managers. The whole family, from Lester to Leslie, kept our books and paid all our bills. Momma Wilburn became like a second mom to me and Doo.<br><br>All the Wilburns, like Doolittle, have passed away. But like my kids are now helping me run my business, their family is the same. Not too long ago, me and my kids and Arvimia and her sons were all together. It was so great to see our children talking about songs and pitching songs and talking business. Just seeing them working together was great. I couldn't stop smiling. Family . . .<br><br><b><br>"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl"</b><br><br>Release date: 1960<br><br>I always heard music when I was growing up, but writing a song is a bit different than just listening. In the mountains people would write about the things that happened, good or bad, so that's just what I did. I guess I had been singing three or four weeks when a girl I had picked strawberries with started coming in the little club where I worked. She would sit in the same booth every night. She never had drunk before, so after about two or three beers she would start to cry. One night on my ten-minute break I got down offstage and asked her why she was coming to the club alone and drinking. She told me her husband had left her and their seven children about three months ago for a younger woman who didn't live too far from where she lived. Then we both cried. That night I wrote this song about her. It was the first song I ever wrote.<br><b>Ever since you left me I've done nothing but wrong<br><br>Many nights I've laid awake and cried<br><br>We was so happy my heart was in a whirl<br><br>But now I'm a honky tonk girl<br><br>So turn that jukebox way up high<br><br>And fill my glass up while I cry<br><br>I've lost everything in this world<br><br>And now I'm a honky tonk girl<br><br>I just can't make a right with all<br><br>of my wrongs<br><br>Every evening of my life seems so long<br><br>I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see<br><br>But losing him has made a fool of me<br><br>So fill my glass up to the brim<br><br>To lose my memory of him<br><br>I've lost everything in this world<br><br>And now I'm a honky tonk girl</b></p><h2>The Azerbaijani Kitchen: A Cookbook</h2><p><p>Azerbaijani cuisine is one of the most ancient and varied in the world, rich with Eastern European and Western Asian influences.</p><p>Over one hundred mouth-watering recipes are included in this book: from pilafs with apricots, dates and plums, aubergine kebab and baked fish with walnuts to halva and sweet crescent pastries.</p><p>With stunning recipes and sumptuous photographs, <i>The Azerbaijani Kitchen</i> is a treat for food lovers and a wonderful introduction to this exotic and delicious cuisine.</p><p>Chef <b>Tahir Amiraslanov</b> is president of the National Culinary Association in Azerbaijan.</p><p><b>Leyla Rahmanova</b> works for the Golden Books publishing house in Baku, Azerbaijani.</p></p><p>Tahir Amiraslanov: Chef Tahir Amiraslanov is President of the National Culinary Association in Azerbaijan, Head of the Traditional Food Committee of the International Popular Art Organization under UNESCO and Vice-President of the Russian Culinary Association.<br><br>Leyla Rahmanova: Leyla Rahmanova graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Languages, Azerbaijan in 2003.

Rejecting such predictable answers as TV violence, permissiveness, and inherent evil, Currie links this crisis to a pervasive "culture of exclusion" fostered by a society in which medications trump guidance and a punitive "zero tolerance" approach to adolescent misbehavior has become the norm.

The only people they talked to &#x201c;for real,&#x201c; if anyone, were their friends, who were usually kids in the same boat-the ones on the outside, the ones nobody else liked. And so they stewed, their sense of failure and grievance festering. Quite often they tried on new identities, predictably those that combined serious &#x201c;badness&#x201d; with great power. Better to be identified as a villain, a monster, or a vampire than just a dumb screw-up; better to be Satan, or Hitler, than a messed-over little nothing. Better, at the extreme, to go out in a blaze of glory than to face more of that excruciating sense of rejection and insignificance. When the explosion came, it was usually a surprise to the surrounding adults, but was almost always understandable from the kids&#x2019; angle of vision. Driving their parents&#x2019; car into a wall, shooting someone, defacing a church-these represented both an assertion of identity and the drawing of a line, a refusal to &#x201c;take it&#x201d; any more.</p></p><h2>Black Tide Rising (5)</h2><p>RESIST THE ZOMBIE PLAGUE!<br><br>The news that humanity had been dreading for ages had come true.

In <i>The Great Awakening</i>, scholar and Zen teacher David Loy examines how these three poisons, embodied in society's institutions, lie at the root of all social maladies as well. The teachings of Buddhism present a way that the individual can counteract these to alleviate personal suffering, and in the <i>The Great Awakening</i> Loy boldly examines how these teachings can be applied to institutions and even whole cultures for the alleviation of suffering on a collective level.<br><br>This book will help both Buddhists and non-Buddhists to realize the social importance of Buddhist teachings, while providing a theoretical framework for socially engaged members of society to apply their spiritual principles to collective social issues. <i>The Great Awakening</i> shows how Buddhism can help our postmodern world develop liberative possibilities otherwise obscured by the anti-religious bias of so much contemporary social theory.</p><p>David R. Loy's previous books include the acclaimed <i>Money, Sex, War, Karma</i>, <i>The Great Awakening: A Buddhist Social Theory</i>, and <i>The Dharma of Dragons and Daemons</i>, a finalist for the 2006 Mythopoeic Scholarship Award. He was the Besl Professor of Ethics/Religion and Society at Cincinnati's Xavier University."Now that I'm growing old, I look for deeper meaning everywhere. Loy's book sure gave me some--not only on that personal how-to-live-my-life level, but also in the universal realm of what's-this-all-about." Author: Kalle Lasn, Editor-in-Chief of Adbusters Magazine and author of Culture Jam--The Uncooling of America<br><br>"A groundbreaking book from an original thinker." Author: Melvin McLeod, editor of The Best Buddhist Writing series<br><br>"As the Buddhist Peace Fellowship Senior Advisor Alan Senauke once wrote, 'We need a critical understanding of interbeing as detailed and various as the maps of individual consciousness we use in our spiritual practices.' In <i>The Great Awakening</i>, David Loy has endeavored to sketch just such a map. (And Ken Jones's <i>The New Social Face of Buddhism</i> provides a different but complementary perspective for our journey.) Loy's book shows how a Buddhist perspective can help contribute to a fuller understanding of many distinctly modern issues, including globalization, terrorism, biotechnology, and the ecological crisis. Each of his chapters offers many insights. This book will undoubtedly become an important marker on the path of engaged Buddhism." Source: Turning Wheel, The Journal of Socially Engaged Buddhism<br><br>"An intelligent, wide-reaching, provocative book." Source: Inquiring Mind<br><br>"In this daring work, David Loy applies his theory of a Buddhist psychology of 'lack'--the human experience of incompleteness and craving--to a dazzling array of social problems in the world today, including economic injustice and political tyranny, war and terrorism after 9/11, and the destruction of our natural environment. In so doing, he exemplifies the rise of socially engaged Buddhism and this new vehicle of spiritual practice." Author: Professor Christopher S. Queen, Harvard University, editor of Engaged Buddhism in the West<br><br>"Loy extends our understanding of Buddha's teachings by showing how the three poisons of greed, ill-will, and delusion--the sources of all individual suffering--become socially embedded and supercharged in issues ranging from the 'War against Evil' to the reformation of dangerous criminals. Sophisticated theories like the ones Loy presents here are an urgent requirement if socially engaged Buddhism is to reach its full potential." Author: Ken Jones, author of The New Social Face of Buddhism<br><br>"With fruitful results... Loy shows that Buddhist social theory is neither wishful thinking nor a mechanical exercise in trying to match past teachings to present problems... <i>The Great Awakening</i> is arguably the most extensive response to 9/11 published to date. Timely... a formidable critique of Western social thought." Source: Tricycle<br><br>"Loy joins a growing movement of Buddhist figures, such as Thich Nhat Hanh and the Dalai Lama, who apply Buddhist principles to the large issues of the contemporary world. He proves to be a most creative and able communicator. Loy suggests that Buddhist theory and practice leads to the breakdown of the false dualism of self and other, resulting in a motivational sense of communion with those in need and a truly grounded motivation for engagement in building a world in which all people are treated such as oneself would want to be treated. Central to Loy's presentation is an analysis of social Dukkha (longing, desire, suffering) which is the source of human discontent. Social, political and economic institutions and arrangements hold out the promise of ending this discontent, yet fail to do so because, at best, they address only the symptoms of such suffering. The injustice and inequality inherent in such systems actually increase social suffering... One of the most powerful aspects of this book is that Loy's critical eye is not directed only outward, but also toward a frank discussion of the deformations of these principles in traditionally Buddhist societies. Loy is particularly sharp in his criticism of the Zen Samurai (warrior) tradition, so popular in martial arts circles... Loy has written a very important and readable book that deserves wide attention from all who are concerned with the application of spiritual teachings and practices to social theory and social activism." Source: The Ernest Becker Foundation<br><br>"There have been many attempts to understand modern social theory from a Buddhist perspective, but they have not been satisfactory because they were either written by scholars well versed in Buddhist teachings but not with the outside world, or vice versa. Loy, however, seems to bring together an deep understanding of both. More importantly, he displays a sympathetic attitude to both Theravada and Mahayana (as well as Taoist) teachings which gives this book a transcendental relevance. Loy argues that while Buddhism lacks an intrinsic social theory, its teachings do have important economic (and therefore political and social) implications that can help us respond to the New World Order." Source: Eastern Horizon<br><br>"Can we create policies that diminish or inhibit our negative tendencies and encourage the positive? David Loy, Zen teacher, social activist, and professor, skillfully entertains such issues, and offers ways of seeing that can help us make saner policies and recognize the bias in our institutions. The wisdom in this book's pages deserves a wide audience."

A special chapter discusses the application and uses of Qi and Qigong for enhancing martial arts ability as well as a section on soothing massage techniques to help recover quickly from various injuries.</p><p><strong>Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming</strong> is a renowned author and teacher of Chinese martial arts and Qigong. Born in Taiwan, he has trained and taught Taijiquan, Qigong and Chinese martial arts for over forty-five years. He is the author of over thirty books, and was elected by Inside Kung Fu magazine as one of the 10 people who has "made the greatest impact on martial arts in the past 100 years." Dr. Yang lives in Northern California.Chapter 1 Introduction 1-1. General Introduction Qigong (), also called Nei Gong (Internal Gongfu, ), is a practice that has been used by the Chinese people for thousands of years-both to improve and maintain their health and to develop greater power for the martial arts. Gong () means work in Chinese, and Qi () is the energy that circulates within the body, so Qigong means the cultivation of the body&#39;s energy to increase and control its circulation. Although it has been widely practiced for a very long time, many people are confused about Qigong, even in China, and many doubt the possibility of internal energy development, or even the existence of Qi. There are several reasons for this: 1. Until as recently as fifty years ago, most Qigong experts would only teach family members or trusted students, so Qigong knowledge was not widespread. 2. Many of the techniques were developed and cultivated by Buddhist or Daoist monks who would not spread their teachings outside their own temples. 3. Because most people were ignorant of Qigong, it was superstitiously regarded as magic. 4. Lastly, some people learned incorrect methods and experienced no effects from the training, or even injured themselves. This resulted in people either being scornful or fearful of Qigong. You should understand that Qigong has a scientific foundation and theory. It is part of the body of Chinese medicine with a history that goes back thousands of years. The most important books describing Qi and its actions are the Qi Hua Lun (Theory of Qi Variations, ), which explains the relationship between Qi and nature, and the Jing Luo Lun (Theory of Qi Channels and Branches, ), which describes Qi circulation throughout the human body. (Jing, means primary Qi channel or meridian. Luo, refers to the subchannels that branch out from them). A channel, or meridian, is a major connector of the internal organs with the rest of the body. These channels frequently are co-located with major nerves or arteries, but the correspondence is not complete, and it seems that they are neither nerves nor blood vessels, but simply the main routes for Qi. There are twelve main channels and two major vessels (Mai, ) in the body. Along these channels are found the cavities (Xue, ), sometimes known as acupunctu Qigong is also based upon the theory of Yin () and Yang (), which describes the relationship of complementary qualities such as soft and hard, female and male, dark and light, or slow and fast. According to Yin/Yang theory, nature strives for harmony, so that all things are neutral or balanced. Since people are part of nature, they should also strive for balance. Included in Yin/Yang theory is the theory of the five elements or phases. The five elements are Jin (metal, ), Mu (wood, ), Shui (water, ), Huo (fire, ), and Tu (earth, ). These elements are somewhat different from the old European elements of fire, air, water, earth. Again, because people are part of nature, they participate in and are affected by the interplay of the elements. According to Chinese medicine, there are two ways to study health and illness. The first way is externally, called Wai Xiang Jie Pou (). The second is internally, called Nei Shi Gongfu (). Wai Xiang Jie Pou is a way to understand the human body by dissection or by acting physically on the body and observing the results, as in modern laboratory experiments. In Nei Shi Gongfu the researcher learns by introspection. He observes his own body and sensations and develops medical knowledge this way. The Western world has specialized almost exclusively in Wai Xiang () and has viewed Nei Shi () as unscientific, although in recent years this attitude has been changing among the general populace, if not within the medical profession. Nei Shi Gongfu developed from observations of the correspondence between changes in nature and the way people felt, and the discovery of Qi variations. Nature here includes periodic cycles (Tian Shi, ) such as time of day, the seasons, air pressure, wind direction, and humidity. It also includes geographical features (Di Li, ) such as altitude, distance from the equator, and distance from large bodies of water, such as an ocean or a lake. These empirical observations led to the conclusion that Qi circulation is related to nature, and led to a search for ways for people to harmonize with natural variations. In addition, Qi was also observed to be closely related to human affairs (Ren Shi, ). This includes the relationship of Qi to sound, emotion, and food. Because Qi flow is controlled by the brain, agitation of the brain by emotion will affect Qi circulation. The sounds people made in various situations were also observed. For example, in cold weather the sound Si () is used in combination with breathing deeply and keeping the limbs close to the body to help keep warm. The pain from cuts can be relieved by making the sound Xu () and blowing air into the cut. The Xu sound helps to stop the bleeding and calm the liver, and the relaxation of this organ in turn relieves the pain. The sound Hei ()is used to increase a person&#39;s working strength. The sound Ha () will help to relieve fevers the same way a dog&#39;s panting helps it to bear the heat. From all these observations it was concluded that different sounds can relieve the pressure or strain on different organs, and since inner organs were relat</p><h2>Stirring the Pot with Benjamin Franklin: A Founding Father&#39;s Culinary Adventures</h2><p>In this remarkable work, Rae Katherine Eighmey presents Franklin's delight and experimentation with food throughout his life. At age sixteen, he began dabbling in vegetarianism. In his early twenties, citing the health benefits of water over alcohol, he convinced his printing-press colleagues to abandon their traditional breakfast of beer and bread for "water gruel," a kind of tasty porridge he enjoyed. Franklin is known for his scientific discoveries, including electricity and the lightning rod, and his curiosity and logical mind extended to the kitchen. He even conducted an electrical experiment to try to cook a turkey and installed a state-of-the-art oven for his beloved wife Deborah. Later in life, on his diplomatic missions--he lived fifteen years in England and nine in France--Franklin ate like a local. Eighmey discovers the meals served at his London home-away-from-home and analyzes his account books from Passy, France, for insights to his farm-to-fork diet there. Yet he also longed for American foods; Deborah, sent over favorites including cranberries, which amazed his London kitchen staff. He saw food as key to understanding the developing culture of the United States, penning essays presenting maize as the defining grain of America. <i>Stirring the Pot with Benjamin Franklin</i> conveys all of Franklin's culinary adventures, demonstrating that Franklin's love of food shaped not only his life but also the character of the young nation he helped build.</p><p>RAE KATHERINE EIGHMEY is an award-winning author, food historian, and cook. She is the author of numerous books, including <i>Abraham Lincoln in the Kitchen, Soda Shop Salvation</i>, and <i>Food Will Win the War</i>."A new book about Benjamin Franklin covers his 84 years and the food that accompanied them, all based on prodigious research by Rae Katherine Eighmey, a food historian.

His father recorded a Deed of Emancipation in his name on three different occasions, sending young Jim out into the world with his blessings.</p> <p>Jim Beckwourth&#x2019;s apprenticeship as a fur trapper was served with General William Ashley&#x2019;s grueling 1824 winter expedition to the Rocky Mountains. Except for a short stint as an army scout during the Seminole campaign, Jim spent the remainder of his long, eventful life in the West, dying among the Crow Indians whom he loved. He was fur trapper, trader, scout war chief of the Crow Nation, explorer, hotelkeeper, dispatch carrier, storekeeper, prospector, Indian agent for the Cheyennes&#x2015;in short, a mountain man <em>extraordinaire</em>.</p> <p>In his old age Beckwourth dictated an autobiography to T.D. Bonner, a man more interested in making money with Jim&#x2019;s adventures than in accurately recording his life. Beckwourth was later disparaged because of the inaccuracies that crept into Bonner&#x2019;s account.</p></p><p><p><strong>Elinor Wilson, </strong>who grew up in Trinidad, Colorado, ?at the foot of the equestrian statue of Kit Carson,? searched out every scrap of information available to her to prove that Jim Beckwourth was certainly no liar, but was, instead, a man of towering physical strength, indomitable courage, excellent judgment, and without peer in his knowledge of Indian ways. Mr. Wilson, a professional writer, was a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.</p></p><h2>The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 2)</h2><p>After a year spent trying to prevent a catastropic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly quiet. His biggest problem is dealing with his new friend, Tyson--a six-foot-three, mentally challenged homeless kid who follows Percy everywhere, making it hard for Percy to have any "normal" friends.<br><br>But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: The magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters--the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millenia--only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name...the Bermuda Triangle.<br><br>Now Percy and his friends--Grover, Annabeth, and Tyson--must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclopes by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family--one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke.</p><p><b>Rick Riordan</b> is the author of six previous Tres Navarre novels&#x2014;<i>Big Red Tequila,</i> winner of the Shamus and Anthony Awards; <i>Th<b>e Widower&#x2019;s Two-Step, </b></i>winner of the Edgar Award; <i>The Last King of Texas; The Devil Went Down to Austin; Southtown; </i>and<b> </b><i>Mission Road.</i> He is also the author of the acclaimed thriller <i>Cold Springs</i> and the young adult novel <i>The Lightning Thief</i>. Rick Riordan lives with his family in San Antonio, Texas.This action-packed book (second in a series) will delight fans of Percy Jackson, the half-blood son of Poseidon, as Percy once again battles mythical monsters in modern-day settings while on his mission to save the tree that guards Camp Half-Blood. Narrator Jesse Berns helps listeners slip right into the oddly engaging world that Riordan creates, in which contemporary teen characters and those from classical mythology intermingle. Berns is so good at accurately portraying teenagers that it's hard to recall he isn't one; Percy's sarcasm and disdainful tones ("Dude?") are just right, though Berns also reveals his ability to become a satyr, cyclops, or guinea pig ("Reep! Reep!") as required. Berns keeps the pace masterfully taut while also allowing listeners time to revel in the book's humor. J.C.G.

There are twenty of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and a brief biography all told in a manner that is understandable, and enjoyable to children. This book is the perfect introduction to Shakespeare&#39;s work and will open many literary doors for your child!</p><p>English author Edith Nesbit s impressive body of work includes poems, plays, novels, and even ghost stories, however, she is best known for her beloved children s adventure stories, published under the name E. Nesbit. Among Nesbit s best-known works are The Story of the Treasure-Seekers, The Railway Children, The Wouldbegoods and Five Children and It. Nesbit s novels departed from the children s literary tradition of fantasy-worlds popularized by Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, and instead focused on the adventures to be had from real-life experiences. Nesbit s work inspired other writers like C. S. Lewis, P. L Travers, and J. K. Rowling, and many of her stories have been adapted for film and television. In addition to writing, Nesbit was an activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a socialist group that provided the foundation for the modern British Labour Party. Nesbit died in 1924.</p><h2>Every Dead Thing</h2><p>hard to find</p><p>It's a good idea to avoid reading John Connolly's debut novel on a full stomach. His descriptions of mutilated murder victims give him honorary membership in the gore wars club. <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is a fast-paced piece of fiction from an author whose regular stomping ground is as a journalist for the <i>Irish Times</i>. <p> NYPD detective Charlie "Bird" Parker was busy boozing at Tom's Oak Tavern when his wife Susan, and young daughter Jennifer were mutilated by a killer called the Traveling Man. Consumed by guilt and alcoholism, Charlie soon lost his job, and almost his sanity. Several months on he is sober and ready to get his life back in order. Charlie takes up private investigating. One of his first cases involves the disappearance of a woman called Catherine Demeter. At first this puzzle seems unrelated to the Traveling Man--but Charlie has a gut feeling that the slayer is pulling the strings. "I dreamed of Catherine Demeter surrounded by darkness and flames and the bones of dead children. And I knew then that some terrible blackness had descended upon her."</p><p> The search for Catherine takes Charlie on a whirlwind tour of the South. First to the small Virginian town of Haven, where, some 30 years before, Catherine's sister Amy was murdered, along with other local children. But the trail turns cold--until a tip from a psychic leads Charlie to the swamplands of Louisiana. The subplots of Catherine's disappearance, age-old child murders, and the slaying of the Parker family finally unite in the hot, humid terrain. A showdown with the Traveling Man is inevitable.</p><p> <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is classic American crime fiction, and it's hard to believe that John Connolly was born and raised on the Emerald Isle. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of mystery novels, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes,</i> the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series. He lives in Dublin, Ireland.

Freedman in the New York Times Magazine, &#x201c;Foote writes films. He stresses dialogue and character development rather than spectacle or even traditional narrative.&#x201d;<br><br>Each of the three screenplays sprang from a different origin. One was adapted from the novel by Harper Lee, who later wrote, &#x201c;If the integrity of a film adaptation is measured by the degree to which the novelist&#x2019;s intent is preserved, Mr. Foote&#x2019;s screenplay should be studied as a classic.&#x201d; Tender Mercies was conceived for the screen, and The Trip to Bountiful came from Foote&#x2019;s own stage and television play. While each demanded solutions to different cinematic problems, all are marked by Foote&#x2019;s own mastery of the screenwriting form, as well as his understanding of human relationships. All three show a modern Chekhov at work, revealing the deep currents of American society through the simplest details of daily life.</p><p></p><h2>Theology for Disciples</h2><p>This book discusses every major Christian concept in clear and meaningful terms.</p><p>Gilbert W. Stafford served as professor of Christian theology at the Anderson University School of Theology from 1976 until his retirement in 2007. From 1986 to 1996, Dr. Stafford was known to people around the world as the voice of the &#34;&#34;Christian Brotherhood Hour,&#34;&#34; the English-language radio broadcast of the Church of God (Anderson, IN).The scope of this book impresses me. I am not surprised to find a strong ecumenical character of the text, knowing Stafford&#39;s career...I am also pleased with the broad ecclesiological nature of the book as distinct from an individualistic or impersonal treatment. --J.

We are well aware that not a few of them groan beneath the yoke imposed on them by men who in very large part are strangers to the real interests of the country. We recognise that many others were deceived by fal1acious hopes. We blame only the system with its authors and abettors who considered Russia the best field for experimenting with a plan elaborated years ago, and who from there continue to spread it from one end of the world to the other.&#34; In this pamphlet, I have outlined some of the historical evidence which goes to prove that those &#34;strangers to the real interests of Russia,&#34; who are experimenting with this Marxian plan elaborated years ago, are members of the Jewish nation, and that Communism is the latest and, up to the present, the most decadent materialistic phase of the opposition of that nation to the Supernatural Messias.</p><p></p><h2>Did I Kiss Marriage Goodbye?: Trusting God with a Hope Deferred</h2><p><p>Through personal anecdotes and careful examination of Scripture, Carolyn McCulley challenges single women to regard their singleness not as a burden, but as a gift from God that allows them to perform a unique role in the body of Christ.</p></p><p><p><strong>Carolyn McCulley</strong> is a speaker, filmmaker, and award-winning author.

By looking to nature as a teacher rather than simply as a source for raw materials, pioneers in the emerging biomimicry movement are developing design methods and materials to create intelligent buildings that emulate life itself. <br><br>In <em>Hypernatural</em> architecture and material experts Blaine Brownell and Marc Swackhamer present an international collection of forty-two case studies that illustrate astonishing new applications possible in this rapidly growing field, from Echoviren, a botanical pavilion that was designed to wilt into its surrounding redwood forest in Northern California, to the MIT Media Lab's Silk Pavilion, constructed by the threads of silkworms as they passed over scaffolding. Together, these projects show that by looking to nature, design can be a tool that makes our built environment more efficient, sustainable, and, most of all, livable.</p><p>Blaine Brownell is an associate professor of architecture and the director of the Master of Architecture program at the University of Minnesota and the author of numerous PAPress books, including <em>Material Strategies</em> and the Transmaterial series of sourcebooks<br><br>Marc Swackhamer is the head of the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota"Some examples are more illustrative and just hint at future possibilities.

The American family is the fundamental institution that provided the Founding Fathers with the emotional support and driving courage to face the tyrannical government that threatened their very existence. The American family used to be the fundamental institution of our stable, liberty-loving, and very successful society. It is the essential building block of a free society with limited government. In the last hundred years, the American family has been attacked, debased, maligned, slandered, and vilified by every facet of society. No family is safe from the official busybodies. At issue is a rebellion against any sort of moral code. <i>Who Killed the American Family</i> reveals the concerted assault on the American nuclear family by many forces - feminists, judges, lawmakers, psychologists, school districts, college professors, politicians offering incentives and seeking votes, and more - opposed to the traditional American nuclear family, each with its own raison d'etre for wanting to abolish it. The wreckage of the American family leaves us with the inability to have limited government because government steps in to perform tasks formerly done by the nuclear family. Veteran conservative activist and thought leader who lead the charge to successfully defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s&nbsp;Phyllis Schlafly&nbsp;explains how changes in the law, in court decisions,&nbsp;in the culture, in education, and in entertainment have eroded the once-precious institution. Any one of these factors would not have been enough to impact our families, but together they added up to a mighty force. Schlafly not only exposes the tactical charge the Left has implemented, but she offers hope and a plan for stopping anti-marriage incentives and how to restore in our culture the sacred nature of the family unit.</p><p><p><b>Phyllis Schlafly </b>is a national leader of the conservative movement since the publication of her best-selling 1964 book, <i>A Choice Not An Echo</i>. Author of 20 books, Schlafly has written a monthly newsletter since 1967 called <i>The Phyllis Schlafly Report</i> and a syndicated column, which appears in 100 newspapers.

Mrs Schlafly confronts important issues that are ignored by most advocates for the family. The result is the most penetrating account yet of the civilizational implications of radical ideologies that are not only dismantling the family but doing so quite intentionally and methodically and destroying freedom in the process." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Stephen Baskerville</b>, professor of government, Patrick Henry College and author of <i>Taken Into Custody: The War Against Fathers, Marriage, and the Family</i><br><br>"With her characteristic courage and insight, the Iron Lady of the conservative movement indicts all those complicit in the forty-year war on the American family. Phyllis Schlafly exposes how feminists and globalists have worked in cahoots with the public school establishment, the welfare system, the divorce courts, the judges, and 'free trade' activists to deconstruct the very heart of American identity and exceptionalism." &#x2014;&nbsp;<b>Robert W. Patterson</b>, opinion contributor, <i>The Phildelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>"My friend, Phyllis Schlafly, has been a prominent figure in the conservative movement for decades.

Organized around these questions, <em>Theorizing Feminisms: A Reader</em> provides an overview of theoretical feminist writing about the quest for gender justice. Incorporating both classic and cutting-edge material, the reader takes into account the full diversity of women, highlighting the effects of race, ethnicity, nationality, class, sexuality, and religion on women's experience. <br> <em>Theorizing Feminisms</em> is organized into four sections and includes fifty-four essays. The first section introduces several basic concepts commonly employed when thinking about sexism--oppression, social construction, essentialism, intersectionality, gender, race, and class--and also raises questions about the perspective and legitimacy of the theorist. The second section surveys three approaches that attempt to characterize in a general way the source of injustice toward women: humanist feminism ("the sameness approach"), gynocentric feminism ("the difference approach"), and dominance feminism. Offering an alternate perspective, the third section introduces two "localizing" approaches, grounded in postmodernism and identity politics, respectively. Skeptical of theories that attempt to analyze social phenomena across history and culture, authors in this section challenge, rather than answer, the text's organizing questions. The final section explores the relationship of feminist theory to three liberatory projects--postcolonialism, neo-materialism, and queer theory--that do not characterize themselves as feminist, yet take gender as a significant category of analysis. Each section opens with an introduction and each essay is followed by helpful study questions. The majority of the essays are presented in their entirety. <br> <em>Theorizing Feminisms</em> underscores the strong connection between feminist theory and practice by including essays that illustrate important political inspirations or applications of each theoretical approach. It also presents versions of the same approach from various points in history, revealing feminist theory to be dynamic and evolving, rather than static. Ideal for interdisciplinary courses in feminist theory, this volume will also serve as an invaluable reference for current and future generations of theorists.<br></p><p>Elizabeth Hackett is at Agnes Scott College, Decatur.

Shall we appoint elephants to teach zoology?&#x201d; That anecdote, with which D. G. Myers begins <i>The Elephants Teach</i>, perfectly frames the issues this book tackles. <br> <br> Myers explores more than a century of debate over how writing should be taught and whether it can or should be taught in a classroom at all. Along the way, he incorporates insights from a host of poets and teachers, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Robert Frost, John Berryman, John Dewey, Lionel Trilling, Robert Lowell, Ezra Pound, and Saul Bellow. And from his exhaustive research, Myers extracts relevant background information on nineteenth-century educational theory; shifts in technology, publishing, and marketing; the growth of critical theory in this country; and the politics of higher education. While he shows how creative writing has become a machine for creating more creative writing programs, Myers also suggests that its history supplies a precedent for something different&#x2014;a way for creativity and criticism, poetry and scholarship, to join together to produce not just writing programs but good writers. <br> <br> Updated with fresh commentary on what&#x2019;s happened to creative writing in the academy since the first edition was published ten years ago, <i>The Elephants Teach</i> will be indispensable for students and teachers of writing, literature, and literary history.</p></p><p>Prentice Hall Studies in Writing and Culture captures the excitement of an emerging discipline. The writers in this series are challenging basic assumptions, asking new questions, and trying to broaden inquiry about writing and the teaching of writing. These writers raise challenging questions about how we teach and how we build communities of writers. They also investigate subjects as far-ranging as the nature of knowledge and the role that culture plays in shaping pedagogy. The series is particularly concerned with the interplay between language and culture, and about how gender considerations, race, and audience shape our writing and our teaching. Early volumes will be devoted to the essay, audience, autobiography, and how writers teach writing. Other studies will explore matters that are critical to teaching writing. The Elephants Teach: Creative Writing Since 1880 traces the development of &#34;creative&#34; writing as (1) a classroom subject, the teaching of fiction- and verse-writing; and (2) a national system for the employment of fiction writers and poets to teach the subject. It answers the questions, &#34;Why has fiction and verse writing come to be called creative?&#34; and &#34;When and why was this term first used?&#34;The Elephants Teach is a captivating account of how creative writing has become an integral part of our culture since the last decades of the nineteenth century. A story of the American will-to-art, it also offers a comprehensive reinterpretation of the development of English as a field of study. D.G. Myers argues that English has been split into three rival and antagonist fields: composition, literary scholarship, and the constructive art of literature, which includes both creative writing and literary criticism. He traces this split from the earliest days of the discipline, when it was called philology, through the rise of English composition and the critical wars of the thirties, down to the present. Along the way, he tells how poets and writers turned to university teaching as a means of economic support, restoring a neglected chapter in the history of American authorship and literary education.</p><h2>Learning Theories in Childhood</h2><p><p>Focusing on the early philosophies of learning and key behavioural, cognitive, and social theorists, including Locke, Rousseau, Montessori, Piaget, Vygotsky, Bandura, Bronfenbrenner &amp; Bruner, this popular book provides a comprehensive overview of children&#x2032;s learning.

Enamoured of British institutions, Continental Europeans turned to the imported masonic lodges and found in them a new forum that was constitutionally constructed and logically egalitarian. Originating in the Middle Ages, when stone-masons joined together to preserve their professional secrets and to protect their wages, the English and Scottish lodges had by the eighteenth century discarded their guild origins and become an international phenomenon that gave men and eventually some women a place to vote, speak, discuss and debate. Margaret Jacob argues that the hundreds of masonic lodges founded in eighteenth-century Europe were among the most important enclaves in which modern civil society was formed. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Britain men and women freemasons sought to create a moral and social order based upon reason and virtue, and dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality. A forum where philosophers met with men of commerce, government, and the professions, the masonic lodge created new forms of self-government in microcosm, complete with constitutions and laws, elections, and representatives. This is the first comprehensive history of Enlightenment freemasonry, from the roots of the society's political philosophy and evolution in seventeenth-century England and Scotland to the French Revolution. Based on never-before-used archival sources, it will appeal to anyone interested in the birth of modernity in Europe or in the cultural milieu of the European Enlightenment.<br></p><p>Margaret C. Jacob is at New School for Social Research."This is one of the most outstanding contributions to the social interpretation of the Enlightenment in recent years. It should serve as a model for younger historians (it will for me) of how to go about tackling a historical problem."--William Connell, Rutgers University<br><br>"Margaret C. Jacob has now carried forward the frontiers again....The book is...a major step towards an account of masonry which satisfactorily integrates it with other sides of the eighteenth century...Professor Jacob ought to be widely read."--The English Historical Review<br><br>"What [Jacob] does do very well is to take us behind the scenes to listen to little groups of people, in one or two eighteenth-century European cities, as they lived their social and intellectual lives in the muddle of ideas, ideals, prejudices, assumptions and social aspirations that make up<br>life as people live it. For that we can all be grateful to her."--French History<br><br>"A model of the new intellectual history. There have been many calls for a 'social history' of the Enlightenment, but few have actually achieved one, and none in such grand fashion. Jacob gets beyond the symbolism and ritual to place Freemasonry squarely within the social and political<br>contexts of eighteenth-century Europe, and the unique breadth of her archival work gives the book a genuine comparative core. This pioneering study--bold, comprehensive, and vivid--is likely to be the standard work on the subject for years to come."--Gary Kates, Trinity University<br><br>"[Jacob's argument] is both elegant and seductive, and she makes an interesting contribution to our knowledge of the period....What she does...very well is to take us behind the scenes to listen to little groups of people, in one or two eighteenth-century European cities, as they lived their<br>social and intellectual lives in the muddle of ideas, ideals, prejudices, assumptions and social aspirations that make up life as people live it. For this we can all be grateful to her."--TLS<br><br>"Jacob offers a very informative, innovative, useful, ambitious study."--American Historical Review<br><br>"A more timely book than Living the Enlightenment would be hard to imagine. Margaret Jacob has constructed a chain of richly documented case studies... Living the Enlightenment ... has no rival in the breadth and depth of its research and in its lucidity on the political import of its<br>subject... Will have a salutary impact on the study of 18th century Freemasonry and on efforts to recover the social and political meaning of the Enlightenment for years to come."--Journal of Modern History<br><br>"A valuable contribution to the scholarship about the Enlightenment and Freemasonry... This study is highly recommended reading"--Journal of Social History<br><br>"A valuable contribution to the social history of the Enlightenment ... Historians of the Enlightenment owe a considerable debt of gratitude to Jacob ...

It describes simple and more complex IRT models and shows how they are applied with the help of widely available software packages. Chapters follow a consistent format and build sequentially, taking the reader from model development through the fit analysis and interpretation phases that one would perform in practice. The use of common empirical data sets across the chapters facilitates understanding of the various models and how they relate to one another.</p><p><p><b>R. J. de Ayala</b> is Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His research interests include psychometrics, item response theory, computerized adaptive testing, applied statistics, and multilevel models.

He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association&#x2019;s Division 5: Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics, as well as of the American Educational Research Association.</p>"This book is jam-packed with useful information. It includes basic, practical programming examples, with clear explanations of WinSTEPS and BILOG scripts, and step-by-step interpretations of goodness of fit in IRT problems. The author also covers more advanced forms of IRT, including multicategory items, multidimensional latent influences, and advanced multiple-group problems of linking and equating. A tour de force!"--John J. McArdle, PhD, Head, Quantitative Methods Area, Department of Psychology, University of Southern California&nbsp;"A very well-organized and useful introduction to IRT. The book has an excellent structure that covers widely used IRT models and most of their major applications. The author has done an outstanding job of balancing the mathematical with the conceptual, and each chapter contains examples of applications to real data using commercially available software. The book is liberally supplemented by the kinds of graphic displays that can help neophytes understand the complexities of IRT. An especially useful feature is the up-front glossary of notation and acronyms. This is an excellent text for a one-semester graduate-level course in IRT, and should provide students with the knowledge they require to delve deeper into IRT models and their applications. It is also a useful reference for psychological and educational researchers who apply IRT in their work."--David J. Weiss, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota; Editor Emeritus, <i>Applied Psychological Measurement</i>&nbsp;"This book provides a thorough overview of item response theory methodology, with a nice blend of theoretical psychometrics and practical applications. The coverage is quite complete, including the standard dichotomous and polytomous unidimensional models as well as multidimensional models. The examples are very useful. This book will serve very well as a technical reference and as a text for upper-level psychometric theory courses."--Mark D. Reckase, PhD, Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology, and Special Education, Michigan State University&nbsp;"De Ayala does a masterful job of describing the fundamental theory and the many applications of IRT. I am impressed by the breadth of models he covers and the detail he presents on various estimation methods. Coverage includes the standard Rasch; one-, two-, and three-parameter models; polytomous and multidimensional models; and applications to linking/equating and differential item functioning. This is a well-written book that will be useful for graduate students, researchers, and practicing measurement specialists in education, health, and psychology. The greatest strength of this book is de Ayala's ability to present IRT in an engaging, accessible manner."--Bruno D. Zumbo, PhD, Paragon&#x2013;UBC Professor of Psychometrics and Measurement, University of British Columbia &nbsp;&nbsp;"Offers a good roadmap to the complex array of IRT model parameters, estimation methods, and readily available IRT programs. By juxtaposing algebraic development of IRT models (and model estimation) alongside annotated results and software output from applied examples, this book provides an excellent resource for both intermediate and advanced IRT practitioners. The applied researcher will find this book to be an excellent practical resource with numerous examples that use multiple software packages to analyze the same datasets."--Scott M. Hofer, PhD, Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, Oregon State University&nbsp;"The book has an excellent balance among the technical, conceptual, and practical aspects of item response theory. It is comprehensive; provides example scripts and output from a variety of popular item response programs; and uses selected data sets throughout the book, making model and program comparisons possible. I also liked the coverage of commonly asked questions related to model fit, item fit, and appropriate sample sizes, which are often missing in item response theory texts."--Kevin J. Grimm, PhD, Department of Psychology, Arizona State University<br>"The main strength of the text is in the descriptions and elaborations of the common IRT models....De Ayala also covers fundamental relationships that exist between models, such as the relationships between the parameters of the nominal response model and the partial credit model. In addition, the chapters contain practical advice for sample sizes commonly used with each model and how to interpret the parameters. De Ayala also presents results as statistical indices and graphics for various examples across different contexts, which allows readers the ability to see how the models work from several different perspectives....Does a good job of introducing common estimation strategies employed in IRT software packages. Especially helpful are the illustrations de Ayala includes with the code from IRT software packages.", <i>Psychometrika</i> Published On: 2009-01-01<br><br>"A must read for practitioners who use item response theory to calibrate test data. It also would serve as a tremendous resource for measurement researchers who daily navigate the circuitous paths of various IRT estimation software programs to analyze and understand their assessment data....Each of the 12 chapters is packed with annotated examples of how to use IRT estimation software and the subsequent output....The author does an excellent job of supplementing explanations of various models with calibration examples and output of multiple data sets using several different IRT calibration software programs including BILOG, MULTILOG, BIGSTEPS, and NOHARM....The book is more practitioner-oriented and applied than previous classic books that provide foundational understanding of IRT models and applications....Would be an excellent text for a graduate level IRT class in which the goal of the course would be to review dichotomous, polytomous, and multidimensional IRT models an how to estimate parameters in the various models using a variety of commercially available software....I would encourage all testing practitioners who work with various IRT models, as well as graduate students who plan to go into the measurement field, to seriously consider this book. It is an excellent resource book and one that provides the reader with insight into the rationale and application of the different IRT models.

"When I'm <em>there</em>, sitting with those folks, listening and talking," he said to Coles, "I'm part of that life, and I'm near it in my head, too.... Back <em>here</em>, sitting near this typewriter--its different. I'm a writer. I'm a doctor living in Rutherford who is describing 'a world elsewhere.'" Williams captured the great difficulty in documentary writing--the gulf that separates the reality of the subject from the point of view of the observer .<br> Now, in this thought-provoking volume, the renowned child psychiatrist Robert Coles, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Children in Crisis</em> series, offers a penetrating look into the nature of documentary work. Utilizing the documentaries of writers, photographers, and others, Coles shows how their prose and pictures are influenced by the <em>observer's</em> frame of reference: their social and educational background, personal morals, and political beliefs. He discusses literary documentaries: James Agee's searching portrait of Depression-era tenant farmers, <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>, and George Orwell's passionate description of England's coal-miners, <em>The Road to Wigan Pier</em>. Like many documentarians, Coles argues, Agee and Orwell did not try to be objective, but instead showered unadulterated praise on the "noble" poor and vituperative contempt on the more privileged classes (including themselves) for "exploiting" these workers. Documentary photographs could be equally revealing about the observer. Coles analyzes how famous photographers such as Walker Evans and Dorthea Lange edited and cropped their pictures to produce a desired effect. Even the shield of the camera could not hide the presence of the photographer. Coles also illuminates his points through his personal portraits of William Carlos Williams; Robert Moses, one of the leaders of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s; Erik H. Erikson, biographer of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther; and others. Documentary work, Coles concludes, is more a narrative constructed by the observer than a true slice of reality.<br> With the growth in popularity of films such as Ken Burns's <em>The Civil War</em> and the controversial basketball documentary <em>Hoop Dreams</em>, the question of what is "real" in documentary work is more pressing than ever. Through revealing discussions with documentarians and insightful analysis of their work, complemented by dramatic black-and-white photographs from Lange and Evans, <em>Doing Documentary Work</em> will provoke the reader into reconsidering how fine the line is between truth and fiction. It is an invaluable resource for students of the documentary and anyone interested in this important genre.<br></p><p>Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist whose series of books on children won him a Pulitzer Prize, has turned his watchful eye to the nature of the documentary and produced a thought-provoking book. In somewhat the manner of James Faris's recent study, <i>Navajo and Photography</i>, Coles reveals how documentarians like Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans edited and cropped their images to produce a desired effect, and raises the question of authenticity versus manipulation. Lange, the subject of a previous biographical study by Coles, comes under close scrutiny as he contrasts her iconic image of a migrant mother with obscure photographs shot moments earlier. The author also recalls James Agee's self-critical appraisal of his and Evans's "insensitivity" and "arrogance" in pursuing an editorial assignment.<br><strong>Robert Coles, M.D.</strong> is a child psychiatrist and the James Agee Professor of Social Ethics at Harvard University. He is a founding member of the Center of Documentary Studies at Duke University.

This book reminds readers that IEP meetings need not be a time of conflict and controversy, and that writing the components of an IEP can become part of a plan for the student&#x2019;s future (Jeremiah 29:11), rather than a dreaded task to complete. The Bible is the most often referenced book. It is this perspective that makes this book unique.</p></p><p></p><h2>The School Reform Landscape: Fraud, Myth, and Lies</h2><p>In The School Reform Landscape: Fear, Mythologies, and Lies, the authors take an in-depth and controversial look at school reform since the launch of Sputnik. They scrutinize school reform events, proposals, and policies from the last 60 years through the lens of critical social theory and examine the ongoing tensions between the need to keep a vibrant unitary system of public education and the ongoing assault by corporate and elite interests in creating a dual system. Some of events, proposals, and policies critiqued include the Sputnik myth, A Nation At Risk, No Child Left Behind, the lies of the Common Core State Standards Initiative, and other common reform schemes. The authors provide an evidence-based contrarian view of the free-market reform ideas and pierce the veil of the new reform policies to find that they are built not upon empirical evidence, but instead rest solidly on foundations of myth, fear, and lies. Ideas for a new set of reform policies, based on empirical evidence and supportive of a unitary, democratic system of education are presented.</p><p>Christopher H.

Orlich is Professor Emeritus of Education and Science Instruction at Washington State University, Pullman, Washington. He is the author of numerous published papers and author or co-author or 16 published books.<br>As the subtitle indicates, Tienken (Seton Hall Univ.) and Orlich (emer., Washington State Univ.) are critical of current school 'reform' efforts, especially overreliance on standardized tests, national curricula (including common core standards), and the spread of charter schools. In the first chapter, they contrast liberal reform policies for an inclusive, democratic school system that emphasizes thinking skills and democratic social values, advocated by proponents from Thomas Jefferson to John Dewey, with parallel reform efforts (such as the 19th-century Lancaster system) that lead to 'dual' educational approaches separating privileged children from the poor. They argue that assertions that schools are failing, postulated by conservatives after the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957, repeated in the 1983 report A Nation at Risk, and presented as justification for the 2001 No Child Left Behind legislation, are false and put forward with little supporting evidence. Current federal policies exemplified by Race to the Top continue this trend and are anti-democratic. This summary of the liberal critique of the current state of education in the US is not particularly well written, but the authors make their case compellingly and cite much of the research and policy literature by others that supports their position. Summing Up: Recommended. General readers, undergraduate students, and professionals. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Is the school reform movement an attack on the country&#x2019;s democratic and unitary system of public education? In The School Reform Landscape: Fraud, Myth, and Lies, co-authors Christopher H. Tienken, an assistant professor at Seton Hall University, and Donald C. Orlich, professor emeritus at Washington State University, make that case. ... The authors present well-researched critiques of 'A Nation at Risk,' No Child Left Behind, charter schools, high-stakes testing, state curriculum standards and the national Common Core State Standards program. Moreover, the abundance of research to support the claims made in The School Reform Landscape stands in stark contrast to the lack of empirical evidence present in so many criticisms of the current state of public education. (<i>School Administrator</i>)<br><br>Tienken and Orlich provide readers with a behind-the-scenes analysis of the Common Core and its accompanying assessment movement, revealing the new standards as &#x2018;empirically vapid&#x2019;, and demonstrating how the performance of US students on high-stakes and international exams has been interpreted in misleading and amateur ways &#x2013; only to manufacture a crisis in our public schools and sell a reform model that purports to close achievement gaps between privileged and disadvantaged groups. ...

Equally ubiquitous, though until now less the subject of serious inquiry, are temporary memorials: spontaneous offerings of flowers and candles that materialize at sites of tragic and traumatic death.

In this context she elaborates why the recognition of the interactive nature of the analytic field has profound and radical implications for one&#39;s thinking about analytic technique, regardless of theoretical orientation. She distinguishes between theory of technique, which relates to what one does with awareness and intention, and theory of therapeutic action, which has to do with what is healing in the psychoanalytic interaction, whether or not it evolves from &#34;technique&#34;. Her premise is that becoming more attuned to therapeutic aspects of the interaction, which often elude awareness, and to the dialectical relationship between the interpersonal and the intrapsychic can enable psychoanalysts to refine their theory of technique and ability to use themselves as analytic instruments so as to expand the limits of what can be achieved with all patients through analytic work. Stressing the importance of attending to the affective relationship and the role of unconscious communication and enactment in the analytic interaction, she illustrates how the analytic expanse is enlarged, and a unique kind of intimacy and contextual safety generated, as these dimensions of the interaction, often beyond words and accessible only through the countertransference, begin to be explicitly acknowledged and addressed. Extensive data from the treatment of patients who have traditionally been considered unanalyzable reveal the rich rewards of working at this &#34;intimate edge&#34;, the unique value of playfulness, and the role of encounter in the process of working through. The emphasisis on how to turn potential impasse into analytic opportunity by realizing the unique possibilities of the analytic moment. These examples demonstrate that even with patients who have been violated and abused, and for whom cynicism, terror and despair may have long prevailed, it is possible to achieve the kind of psychoanalytic engagement that can lead to the reawakening of hope and desire. This book will be welcomed by clinicians at all levels of expertise with an interest in expanding the reaches of analytic possibility. It will also be of interest to anyone who has ever been a patient, who has thought of becoming one, or who is curious about how the analytic process can change people&#39;s lives.</p><h2>Human Dimensions of Wildlife Management</h2><p><p>Wildlife professionals can more effectively manage species and social-ecological systems by fully considering the role that humans play in every stage of the process. <i>Human Dimensions of Wildlife Management</i> provides the essential information that students and practitioners need to be effective problem solvers.

What this interconnected destiny has meant for American Jews and how it has defined their experience among the world's Jews is fully chronicled in this work, a comprehensive and finely nuanced history of Jews in the United States from 1654 through the end of the past century. Hasia R. Diner traces Jewish participation in American history&#x2015;from the communities that sent formal letters of greeting to George Washington; to the three thousand Jewish men who fought for the Confederacy and the ten thousand who fought in the Union army; to the Jewish activists who devoted themselves to the labor movement and the civil rights movement. <br><br>Diner portrays this history as a constant process of negotiation, undertaken by ordinary Jews who wanted at one and the same time to be Jews and full Americans. Accordingly, Diner draws on both American and Jewish sources to explain the chronology of American Jewish history, the structure of its communal institutions, and the inner dynamism that propelled it. Her work documents the major developments of American Judaism&#x2015;he economic, social, cultural, and political activities of the Jews who immigrated to and settled in America, as well as their descendants&#x2015;and shows how these grew out of both a Jewish and an American context. She also demonstrates how the equally compelling urges to maintain Jewishness and to assimilate gave American Jewry the particular character that it retains to this day in all its subtlety and complexity.</p><p>"Hasia Diner's history of American Jewry effortlessly surpasses its predecessors. A work of both synthesis and analysis, it ranges widely, incorporating insights from social, cultural, political, and religious history. Both the specialist and the general reader will profit from its clarity and intelligence. In particular, its novel periodization will spark discussion of conventional ways of thinking about the development of the American Jewish community."&#x2015;Todd M. Endleman, author of <i>The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000</i><br><br>"Author of many books on immigration, foodways, and other topics, Hasia Diner now brings us an exceptionally fine, candid, and often surprising one-volume narrative of the entire run of American Jewish history. Meticulously accurate yet smoothly flowing, it will enlighten and delight knowledgeable and new readers alike. A 'must read'-and now the best read-on the subject."&#x2015;Walter T. Nugent, author of <i>Crossings: The Great Transatlantic Migrations, 1870-1914</i><br><br>"The Jews of the United States is a masterful and richly textured account of the Jewish experience in this country over 350 years. Diner has produced an important book, at once systematic and synthetic, that attends to the many diverse expressions of Jewish life in America. With grace, clarity, and erudition, she explores the social, religious, and institutional life of Jews in the United States, enlivening her story throughout with intriguing personalities and anecdotes.

Human Security: Theory and Action explores the theory and application of concepts central to this notion of security. It examines the conceptual roots of human security, connecting its origins to its applications and challenges in war and peacetime. With a unique focus on the evolving notion of responsibility for security, the text introduces the critical questions and priorities that underpin policies and actions. <br>The text is organized around four sections. The introduction offers an overview of human security and its basic tenets and historical foundations. The second section focuses on human security in armed conflict and post-conflict reconstruction, discussing such issues as the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect (R2P), peacekeeping and peace negotiation processes, and humanitarian assistance. The third section identifies the long-term issues that are necessary for a durable human security, including human rights, food security, poverty, gender equality, health security, and environmental sustainability. The final section applies the concepts introduced in the book to twenty-first century concerns and offers insights on turning theory into action.<br>Integrated into the text are many case studies to broaden the student&#x2019;s awareness beyond the conflicts and issues that dominate the media.

Case studies of leading organizations including Mars, Statoil, LEGO, British Columbia Lottery Corporation, and Astro illustrate the real-world implementation of ERM on a macro level, while also addressing how ERM informs the response to specific incidents. Readers will learn how top companies are effectively constructing ERM systems to positively drive financial growth and manage operational and outside risk factors. By addressing the challenges of adopting ERM in large organizations with different functioning silos and well-established processes, this guide provides expert insight into fitting the new framework into cultures resistant to change.</p> <p>Enterprise risk management covers accidental losses as well as financial, strategic, operational, and other risks. Recent economic and financial market volatility has fueled a heightened interest in ERM, and regulators and investors have begun to scrutinize companies' risk-management policies and procedures. <i>Implementing Enterprise Risk Management</i> provides clear, demonstrative instruction on establishing a strong, effective system. Readers will learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Put the right people in the right places to build a strong ERM framework</li> <li>Establish an ERM system in the face of cultural, logistical, and historical challenges</li> <li>Create a common language and reporting system for communicating key risk indicators</li> <li>Create a risk-aware culture without discouraging beneficial risk-taking behaviors</li> </ul> <p>ERM is a complex endeavor, requiring expert planning, organization, and leadership, with the goal of steering a company's activities in a direction that minimizes the effects of risk on financial value and performance. Corporate boards are increasingly required to review and report on the adequacy of ERM in the organizations they administer, and <i>Implementing Enterprise Risk Management</i> offers operative guidance for creating a program that will pass muster.</p></p><p><p><b>IMPLEMENTING ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT</b> </p><p>Enterprise risk management (ERM) is a growing field, but it is not often taught in business schools, and few executives really understand it.

In this newly revised third edition, the manual has been extensively updated to reflect new developments in inorganic chemistry. Twenty-three experiments are divided into five sections: solid state chemistry, main group chemistry, coordination chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry. The included experiments are safe, have been thoroughly tested to ensure reproducibility, are illustrative of modern issues in inorganic chemistry, and are capable of being performed in one or two laboratory periods of three or four hours. Because facilities vary from school to school, the authors have included a broad range of experiments to help provide a meaningful course in almost any academic setting. Each clearly written &amp; illustrated experiment begins with an introduction that hig! hlights the theme of the experiment, often including a discussion of a particular characterization method that will be used, followed by the experimental procedure, a set of problems, a listing of suggested Independent Studies, and literature references.</p><p>The authors are both professors in the chemistry department of the University of Illinois, Urbana.This is an excellent update to a classic inorganic chemistry laboratory text. --Professor Margret J. Geselbracht, Reed College<br><br>It is highly recommended as a textbook for a one-semester advanced inorganic synthesis course. --Synth. React. Inorg. Met.

Tracing changing ideals of fairness from the 1920s to the 1970s, she shows how a deeply embedded set of beliefs, or "gendered imagination" shaped seemingly neutral social legislation to limit the freedom and equality of women. Law and custom generally sought to protect women from exploitation, and sometimes from employment itself; but at the same time, they assigned the most important benefits to wage work. Most policy makers (even female ones) assumed from the beginning that women would not be breadwinners. Kessler-Harris shows how ideas about what was fair for men as well as women influenced old age and unemployment insurance, fair labor standards, Federal income tax policy, and the new discussion of women's rights that emerged after World War II. Only in the 1960s and 1970s did the gendered imagination begin to alter--yet the process is far from complete.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alice Kessler-Harris</strong> is the R. Gordon Hoxie Professor of American History at Columbia University, where she also teaches in the Institute for Research on Women and Gender. A leading advocate of women's rights in the United States, she has been a featured speaker at a special White House symposium and an expert guest on the PBS documentary "The Measured Century." She is the author of <em>Out to Work</em>, <em>A Woman's Wage</em>, and <em>Women Have Always Worked</em>.<br><br>"Through her painstaking examination of major legislation, Alice Kessler-Harris creates a framework for understanding not only the past but also the struggles women face today."--<em>The Women's Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"<em>In Pursuit of Equity</em> is a sensitive and illuminating exploration of the manifold ways in which gendered habits of mind shape social action. It is a contribution not just to the history of the past but to the history of the future."--Arthur Schlesinger Jr.<p></p><br>"Kessler-Harris's cautious optimism about our shared economic future is hard to resist."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Broad in scope and enriched by detailed research....<em>In Pursuit of Equity</em> is a fine work, with an important and nuanced argument, the kind of book that forces one to rethink assumptions about gender, politics, citizenship, and the struggle for social justice."--Miriam Cohen, Evalyn Clark Professor of History, Vassar College, <em>Business History Review</em><p></p><br>"No one has yet done what Alice Kessler-Harris has in her newest book <em>In Pursuit of Equity</em>, reaching beyond [T.H.] Marshall and his critics to suggest a new concept, economic citizenship. In this history of how women have been treated in employment, tax, and welfare policy, Kessler-Harris--arguably the leading historian of women's labor in the United States--synthesizes several decades of feminist analysis to produce a holistic conception of what full citizenship for women might entail. In lucid prose with vivid (and sometimes comic) illustrations of the snarled thinking that results from conceiving of women as dependents--rather than equal in heading families--she offers a vision of how we can move toward greater democracy. In the process, she also shows us what we are up against. Her book illustrates brilliantly how assumptions about appropriate gender roles are built into all aspects of policy."--Linda Gordon, <em>The Nation</em><p></p><br>"A vigorous historical analysis of the 20-century U.S. social policies that produced differential access to resources for men and women....Kessler-Harris succeeds in showing how gender has shaped the rules by which we live, how gendered habits of mind have been inscribed in social policies that continue to frame our lives, and how, once these habits are embedded in the legislative, judicial, and policymaking mechanisms of society, only such a critical, penetrating analysis as this can challenge them and begin to advance the cause of modern feminism."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"<em>In Pursuit of Equity</em> is the latest testament to Alice Kessler-Harris' original scholarship. Professor Kessler-Harris brilliantly documents the often subtle ways that women have been historically denied economic citizenship in the United States. This book enhanced my awareness of the impact of what she calls 'the gendered imagination' in the shaping of policies that lead to enduring forms of economic inequality."--William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University, author of <em>When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor</em><p></p><br>"Alice Kessler-Harris's brilliant research and analyses create a heartening, galvanizing alternative to these cruel times. Armed by this splendid book, we have the tools finally to move beyond America's disgraceful economic traditions of employment injustice, rampant poverty, contempt for women--and on to gender equity, empowerment, and dignity for all."--Blanche Wiesen Cook, University Distinguished Professor, John Jay College and The Graduate Center, CUNY, author of <em>Eleanor Roosevelt, 1884-1933</em> and <em>Eleanor Roosevelt: The Defining Years, 1933-1938</em><p></p><br>"In one of the most brilliant books of recent years, Alice Kessler-Harris explains how modern feminism has been grounded in the changing meanings of work. Formidable research and eloquent writing make it clear why gender difference as a rationale for distributing jobs, taxes, and entitlements came to a screeching crash in our own lifetimes. This is a book for everyone who cares about social policy and democratic citizenship."--Linda K. Kerber, University of Iowa, author of <em>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship</em><p></p><br>"Anyone interested in envisioning what 'liberty and justice for all' might really look like will benefit from learning this book's robust concept of economic citizenship. The long tradition of sex differentiation in law and policy--and the forces enabling it to be re-seen as sex discrimination--gain stunning clarity through Kessler-Harris's measured, probing, insistent analysis. She reopens assumptions about what is 'normal' and what is 'in the public interest' in matters of gender and work and family."--Nancy Cott, Sterling Professor of History and American Studies at Yale, and author of <em>Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation</em><p></p><br>"Broad in scope and enriched by detailed research....<em>In Pursuit of Equity</em> is a fine work, with an important and nuanced argument, the kind of book that forces one to rethink assumptions about gender, politics, citizenship, and the struggle for social justice."--Miriam Cohen, Evalyn Clark Professor of History, Vassar College, <em>Business History Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective</h2><p>Global environmental change and recent worldwide infectious-disease outbreaks make the ecological perspective of medical anthropology more important a field of study than ever.

Less familiar but far more serious is the way some use networked technologies to target real people, subjecting them, by name and address, to vicious, often terrifying, online abuse. In an in-depth investigation of a problem that is too often trivialized by lawmakers and the media, Danielle Keats Citron exposes the startling extent of personal cyber-attacks and proposes practical, lawful ways to prevent and punish online harassment. A refutation of those who claim that these attacks are legal, or at least impossible to stop, <i>Hate Crimes in Cyberspace</i> reveals the serious emotional, professional, and financial harms incurred by victims.</p><p>Persistent online attacks disproportionately target women and frequently include detailed fantasies of rape as well as reputation-ruining lies and sexually explicit photographs. And if dealing with a single attacker&#x2019;s &#x201c;revenge porn&#x201d; were not enough, harassing posts that make their way onto social media sites often feed on one another, turning lone instigators into cyber-mobs.</p><p><i>Hate Crimes in Cyberspace</i> rejects the view of the Internet as an anarchic Wild West, where those who venture online must be thick-skinned enough to endure all manner of verbal assault in the name of free speech protection, no matter how distasteful or abusive. Cyber-harassment is a matter of civil rights law, Citron contends, and legal precedents as well as social norms of decency and civility must be leveraged to stop it.</p></p><p>Danielle Keats Citron is Lois K. Macht Research Professor of Law at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.&#x201c;Vividly written and carefully argued, the book is a fine account of law in this area... We should, as Citron argues, reject the facile romanticization of the Internet as the last frontier of true freedom. We should acknowledge that the Internet both facilitates expression and silences, both allows speech and muzzles it... The major contribution of Citron&#x2019;s book is its lucid summary of the vast network of laws, both state and federal, that are pertinent to cyberabuse. As she shows, we can do quite a lot for victims of cyberabuse without chilling expression... Citron confronts the perpetual free-speech/First Amendment problems attendant to her family of proposals head-on, and the case she makes is persuasive... Citron makes a number of useful proposals for legal reform while convincing readers of the seriousness of the problem.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martha C. Nussbaum</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With the amount of research, detail, and sharp, straightforward suggestions in this book, you can almost hear Citron daring her readers to attempt any kind of counterargument, because one simply doesn&#x2019;t exist... <i>Hate Crimes</i> fully delivers on its promise to elucidate the possible legal responses to online harassment and revenge porn, and policymakers&#x2015;Citron&#x2019;s intended audience&#x2015;will be well served by its clarity... The author derives a lot of firing power from comparing the modern-day fight against online harassment to the 1970s-era fights for the criminalization of sexual harassment in the workplace, and, to a lesser extent, to the fight for the acknowledgement of (and due punishment for) domestic violence. Her comparisons with other feminist fights for equality are both apt and poignant, and the economic injustice of online harassment is certainly deserving of swift and meaningful solutions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jordan Larson</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Baffler</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Citron...focuses on how online hate speech ruins lives, most often women&#x2019;s lives. She cites surveys that show that 60 to 70 percent of cyberstalking victims are women, and she details cases in which women have been targeted, defamed, and threatened with rape and murder... The very same things that make the Internet such a uniquely powerful medium for freedom of speech make it a uniquely powerful medium for hate crimes... The difficult question&#x2015;as always in First Amendment and most constitutional litigation&#x2015;is where to draw the line. In grappling with that and offering provisional answers, Citron [does] a great service.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Erwin Chemerinsky</b><b>, </b><b><i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book sets forth a compelling argument that the internet should not be allowed to maintain its &#x2018;Wild West&#x2019; anarchic status, because its ability to facilitate cyber-bullying outweighs the virtues of maintaining that status... <i>Hate Crimes in Cyberspace</i>&#x2019;s main strength lies in its sustained and detailed exploration of the bizarrely convoluted, sustained and extremely hurtful nature of online abuse of individuals... Its pioneering research could and should be used to support the case for introducing a criminal offence of gender-based hate speech in various countries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Helen Fenwick</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Danielle Citron&#x2019;s <i>Hate Crimes in Cyberspace</i> is a breakthrough book... Citron does a thorough and admirable service of clearly delineating the avenues for legal relief that already exist, thus belying the widely held belief that this behavior is totally unregulated and therefore beyond the law&#x2019;s reach. Cyberspace is not a completely unregulated wild west, and perpetrators of hate crimes as well as their victims need to know that. Citron calls for greater enforcement of all of these laws that already target hate crimes in cyberspace... The book thus serves as a blueprint for what Citron insightfully calls a new civil rights movement. It gives legal representatives and victims a roadmap for charting out legal actions that can be taken to halt the abuse being currently suffered, and to compensate for past harms. It gives state and federal legislators a menu of options for strengthening the law in this area, so that cyberspace can be a safe as well as robust domain for the expression of views on all subjects. It responds to First Amendment worries about the possibility that her proposed reforms might chill valuable speech, and it suggests paths for interested private parties who want to affect the trajectory here outside the law. It&#x2019;s a tour de force and I believe it will succeed. It will change the law, change the conversation, and change attitudes toward and regarding this extraordinarily abusive and harmful behavior. It will strengthen women&#x2019;s civil rights, and thus strengthen women&#x2019;s equality and at core, it will be a significant step toward ensuring women&#x2019;s safety in the public space of employment and education, as well as in cyberspace and the home. This is a book to celebrate, to study, to argue over, and, mostly, to use... This book makes a powerful case that we must do something about this conduct, and that we must use law to do it. There simply must be a more robust legal response to harmful, hateful, and misogynistic behavior, in cyberspace, no less than in workplaces and the home. That is a huge contribution, to women&#x2019;s equality, to the quality of our social and civic life, and to the justice of our law.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robin West</b><b>, </b><b><i>Jotwell</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Citron&#x2019;s] book comprehensively catalogs the many forms of online harassment&#x2015;from revenge porn to anonymous cyber mobs&#x2015;arguing that we need more robust laws to criminalize it and that law enforcement needs to take the cases more seriously... Her book attempts to persuade readers of the real damage wrought by digital attacks with examples of some of the worst harassment that&#x2019;s happened online... Citron hopes her book convinces readers that harassment online should be taken seriously, and that a robust legal and enforcement framework is created to make the Internet a less chilling place for women.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kashmir Hill</b><b>, </b><b><i>Forbes</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There sometimes seems to be a river of hate on the internet, flowing steadily through different social media; people are often hurt, and there is no obvious end to it. In this book, Danielle Citron, an American law professor, proposes, with quiet authority, how we, as digital citizens, lawmakers, internet intermediaries and educators, can make a change.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katharine Quarmby</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;To be sure, police and prosecutors regularly fail to enforce existing laws when it comes to online abuse, either because they don&#x2019;t take the abuse seriously or because they lack the technological skills to find the perpetrators. But while better training and more resources are certainly necessary, Citron argues persuasively that the law itself needs to evolve as well.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michelle Goldberg</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It is the first systematic account of the problem, and how to counter it. Citron proposes practical and lawful ways in which to punish online harassment and also demonstrates the emotional, professional and financial damage incurred by victims.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katharine Quarmby</b><b>, </b><b><i>Newsweek</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] excellent new book...which dives into the negative consequences of connectivity and suggests legal and ethical remedies that may help people who are the targets of abuse and harassment... I think the book deserves to get a wide audience, particularly as legislatures and tech companies struggle to grapple with the consequences of connectivity. While [Citron] writes from the informed perspective of a legal scholar and researcher, the prose is clear and her approach should be accessible to lay audiences... Citron connects the experiences of women and minorities in the 20th century and the civil rights laws that were enacted to prevent or penalize discrimination against people on the basis of race or gender, with the challenges that confront people in the 21st century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Alex Howard</b><b>, </b><b><i>TechRepublic.com</i></b></p><h2>Ethnographic Fieldwork: An Anthropological Reader</h2><p>Newly revised, <i>Ethnographic Fieldwork: An Anthropological Reader Second Edition</i> provides readers with a picture of the breadth, variation, and complexity of fieldwork.

Numbers chronicles the remarkable resurgence of antievolutionism since the 1960s, as well as the creationist movement's tangled religious roots in the theologies of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, and Adventists, among others. His book offers valuable insight into the origins of various "creation science" think tanks and the people behind them. It also goes a long way toward explaining how creationism, until recently viewed as a "peculiarly American" phenomenon, has quietly but dynamically spread internationally--and found its expression outside Christianity in Judaism and Islam.</p></p><p>&#34;For those interested in the background of the modern revival of creationism, whether evolutionists or creationists, this book is a rich mine of information and historical insights.&#34;--Henry M.

Morgan (Harvard Studies in Business History)</h2><p><p><i>Gentlemen Bankers</i> investigates the social and economic circles of one of America&#x2019;s most renowned and influential financiers to uncover how the Morgan family&#x2019;s power and prestige stemmed from its unique position within a network of local and international relationships.</p><p>At the turn of the twentieth century, private banking was a personal enterprise in which business relationships were a statement of identity and reputation. In an era when ethnic and religious differences were pronounced and anti-Semitism was prevalent, Anglo-American and German-Jewish elite bankers lived in their respective cordoned communities, seldom interacting with one another outside the business realm. Ironically, the tacit agreement to maintain separate social spheres made it easier to cooperate in purely financial matters on Wall Street. But as Susie Pak demonstrates, the Morgans&#x2019; exceptional relationship with the German-Jewish investment bank Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., their strongest competitor and also an important collaborator, was entangled in ways that went far beyond the pursuit of mutual profitability.</p><p>Delving into the archives of many Morgan partners and legacies, <i>Gentlemen Bankers</i> draws on never-before published letters and testimony to tell a closely focused story of how economic and political interests intersected with personal rivalries and friendships among the Wall Street aristocracy during the first half of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Susie J.

Patanjali refers to his yoga as "Kriya Yoga": the "yoga of action with awareness". Until now, commentators have treated it as a philosophical reference, and have largely ignored its implications for yogic practice. They have also ignored the fact that it is also an esoteric work, and that only initiates, with sufficient prior experience, can grasp its deeper meaning. <p>This new translation and commentary provides a practical guide to Self-realization or enlightenment. It clearly explains how to apply Patanjali's profound philosophical teachings in everyday life, in any situation with a unique "practice" section after each verse's commentary. There is also comparison with "Thirumandiram" a classic work of the siddha tradition. </p><p>"Marshall Govindan's Kriya Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Siddhas is a valuable addition to the study of Yoga in general and the Yoga-Sutra in particular. I can whoehearedly recommend it... In particular, the growing number of students of Kriya Yoga throughout the world will find his treatmant indispensable, but others will benefit from it." From the Foreword by Dr. Georg Feuerstein, Ph D. author of "The Sutras of Patanjali" and the "Encyclopedia of Yoga".</p></p><p>Marshall Govindan has practiced Babaji's Kriya Yoga intensively since 1969. He studied and practiced Kriya Yoga in India for five years with Yogi S.A.A. Ramaiah, assisting him in the establishment of 23 yoga centers around the world during an 18 year period. During this period he practiced Kriya Yoga for eight hours per day on average, and as a result attained Self-realization. <p>While in India he studied the Tamil language and the works of the Tamil Yoga Siddhas. In 1980 he assisted in the collection and publication of the complete writings of Siddhar Boganathar. In 1986 he administered the construction of a rehabilitation hospital dedicated to Yoga therapy and physical therapy in Tamil Nadu, India. In 1988 he was asked by Babaji Nagaraj, the founder of Kriya Yoga to begin teaching. In 1991, he wrote the best selling book, "Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga Tradition", now published in 9 languages. In 1992 he established Babaji's Kriya Yoga Ashram in St. Etienne de Bolton, Quebec.

Or quolls and quokkas? And potoroos and pademelons? These animals live on the continent of Australia, along with kangaroos, koalas, and many other marsupials. With breathtaking full-page images, including a double-gatefold spread, Sibert-Honor photographer Nic Bishop introduces the beauty and diversity of these amazing animals. The simple, engaging text presents both basic information and fun, quirky facts about marsupials' appearance, habits, and life cycle.

Visit him online at www.nicbishop.com.Starred Review. Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;This book is full of the exceptional-quality photographs and enticing facts that readers have come to expect from Bishop. His endnotes explain how he captured the images using trip wires and bait for many of these nocturnal mammals. In addition to captions, an informative sentence is highlighted in a contrasting color and larger type within explanatory paragraphs that accompany each stunning image. Readers learn that baby koalas eat "pap," a mushy, green baby food that is actually their mother's "poop," that some marsupials don't have pouches, and that all start out the size of a bean or smaller. Details like these are accompanied by tangible analogies that enhance the facts. The center spread opens out into four pages that reveal a dramatic multiple exposure of a sugar glider leaping across an expanse in a sequence that captures its flight. This is a book to wow young audiences.&#x2014;<i>Janet S. Thompson, Chicago Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Over his long career, Heath knew many jazz giants such as Charlie Parker and played with other innovators including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and especially Dizzy Gillespie. Heath also won their respect and friendship. <br>In this extraordinary autobiography, the legendary Heath creates a OC dialogueOCO with musicians and family members. As in jazz, where improvisation by one performer prompts another to riff on the same theme, I Walked with Giants juxtaposes HeathOCOs account of his life and career with recollections from jazz giants about life on the road and making music on the worldOCOs stages. His memories of playing with his equally legendary brothers Percy and Albert (aka OC TootieOCO) dovetail with their recollections. <br>Heath reminisces about a South Philadelphia home filled with music and a close-knit family that hosted musicians performing in the cityOCOs then thriving jazz scene. Milt Jackson recalls, OC I went to their house for dinnerOC JimmyOCOs father put Charlie Parker records on and told everybody that we had to be quiet till dinner because he had Bird onOC . When I [went] to Philly, IOCOd always go to their house.OCOaaa Today Heath performs, composes, and works as a music educator and arranger. By turns funny, poignant, and extremely candid, HeathOCOs story captures the rhythms of a life in jazz.</p><p>Jimmy Heath is widely recognized as one of the greats in jazz. A saxophonist, composer, arranger, and educator, Heath grew up in Philadelphia with his renowned brothers, Percy, the longtime bassist with the Modern Jazz Quartet, and Albert &#x201c;Tootie&#x201d;, a highly respected drummer. The three formed the Heath Brothers Band in the &#x2019;70s.

Nonsectarian and multicultural, the text suggests a divine presence rather than anthropomorphizing, by utilizing simple questions such as "What does God look like?" and "How does God make things happen?" to guide youngsters' understanding of this very abstract concept. The result is more a feeling than an answer, with God primarily represented by several easily understood metaphors such as the wonder of nature ("God is in-caterpillars chewing leaves from daisies,/And in worms turning leaves into earth"), and the loving cooperation of a family ("See sisters taking turns on the slide,/And brothers sharing a new game"). Clearly there is no way to explain certain aspects of God, thus parts of the text seem beyond the grasp of younger readers ("God is wherever we let God in"). However, because the Kushners' intent is to explore rather than describe God, there is room for children's own spiritual awareness to grow. Watercolor illustrations are simple, bright, and nicely textured, portraying people of all ages in friendly and caring situations. Similar in tone to Virginia L. Kroll's I Wanted to Know all about God (Eerdmans, 1994), this book provides children of many faiths with a bridge between the tangible and spiritual world.-Teri Markson, Stephen S.

The original publication, issued by GPC in 1989, was based entirely on source material located in the United Kingdom, while this volume contains primary and secondary material from both U.K. and U.S. sources. The Supplement concentrates, moreover, on seventeenth-century emigration, a far more difficult period to document than that of the following century. The four main phases of Scottish immigration during this century were: (1) Nova Scotia in the 1620s; (2) New England and the Chesapeake mid-century; (3) South Carolina in the mid-1680s; and (4) East New Jersey, also in the mid-1680s. In total, probably around 4,000 Scots settled between Stuartstown, South Carolina and Port Royal, Nova Scotia before 1700. Thanks to the unstinting efforts of Mr. Dobson, virtually all of them are identified in The Original Scots Colonists and in this present Supplement.</p><p></p><h2>The Sketchbook Challenge: Techniques, Prompts, and Inspiration for Achieving Your Creative Goals</h2><p>Have you ever bought a new sketchbook, opened to the first page, and thought, "Now what do I do?"

This has made necessary slight changes of meaning in several of the connecting words. This will be noted especially with regard to the word "adeoque," which Boscovich uses with a variety of shades of meaning, from "indeed," "also" or "further," through "thus", to a decided "therefore," which would have been more correctly rendered by "ideoque." There is only one phrase in English that can also take these various shades of meaning, viz., "and so;" and this phrase, for the use of which there is some justification in the word "adeo" itself, has been usually employed.<br><br>The punctuation of the Latin is that of the author.

Read his exclusive Amazon essay on <em>Homer &amp; Langley</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>I was a teenager when the Collyer brothers were found dead in their Fifth Avenue brownstone. Instantly, they were folklore. And so there is the real historical existence of them and the mythological existence--two existences, as with Abe Lincoln, though of a less exalted standing. I didn&#x2019;t know at the time that I would someday write about them, but even then I felt there was some secret to the Collyers--there was something about them still to be discovered under the piles of things in their house--the bales of newspapers and the accumulated detritus of their lives. Was it only that they were junk-collecting eccentrics? You see that every day in the streets of New York. They had opted out--that was the primary fact. Coming from a well-to-do family, with every advantage, they had locked the door and closed the shutters and absented themselves from the life around them. A major move, as life-transforming as emigration. In fact it was a form of emigration, of leave-taking. But where to? What country was within that house? What would have caused them to become the notorious recluses of Fifth Avenue? As myths, the brothers demanded not research but interpretation, and when a few years ago I was finally moved to do this book, I felt as if writing it was an act of breaking and entering just to see what may have been going on in that house, which really meant getting inside two very interesting minds. And with the first sentence, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Homer, the blind brother,&#x201d; I was in.</p> <p>In one sense I think of <em>Homer &amp; Langley</em> as a road novel--as if they are two people traveling together down a road and having adventures, though in fact they are housebound. It turns out that the world will not let them alone--others intrude on their privacy as if it is the road running through them. As for their collecting, I think of them as curators of their life and times, and their house as a museum of all our lives. That is my idea of them, that is my reading of the Collyer myth. I make them to be two brothers who opted out of civilization and pulled the world in after them.<em>--E.L. Doctorow</em></p> <p>(Photo � Philip Friedman)</p><b>E. L.

The world knows now that more than two hundred thousand people died and over a million lost their homes in Haiti's capital and the surrounding cities of L�og�ne, Petit Go�ve, and Jacmel. As I am writing these words, survivors remain huddled by the thousands in displacement camps, most shielding themselves from intermittent rain with nothing but wooden posts and bedsheets.<br><br>Even before the earthquake, life was not easy in Haiti. There was always the risk of dying from hunger, an infectious disease, a natural disaster, or a crime. But there was also hope, laughter, and boundless creativity. Haitian creativity has always been one of the country&#x2019;s most identifiable survival traits. Whether expressed in vibrant and colorful paintings, double entendre--filled spiritual or party music, or the poignant, humorous, erotic, lyrical (and yes, also dark) short stories and novels of its writers, Haiti's more nuanced and complex face often comes across in its arts...<br><br>I can honestly say that, in spite of the difficult circumstances in Haiti right now, I have never felt a greater sense of joy working on any collective project than I have on this book."</i><br></p><p>Akashic recruits Danticat, one of the truly great contemporary writers, to edit this timely volume featuring stories set both before and after the devastating earthquake.<p></p> <p>Launched with the summer '04 award-winning best seller <i>Brooklyn Noir,</i> Akashic Books continues its groundbreaking series of original noir anthologies.

But the question remains: Why climb? In <i>High Exposure,</i> elite mountaineer and acclaimed <i>Everest</i> filmmaker David Breashears answers with an intimate and captivating look at his life. <br> For Breashears, climbing has never been a question of risk taking: Rather, it is the pursuit of excellence and a quest for self-knowledge. Danger comes, he argues, when ambition blinds reason. The stories this world-class climber and great adventurer tells will surprise you -- from discussions of competitiveness on the heights to a frank description of the 1996 Everest tragedy.</p><p>David Breashears has climbed Mt. Everest four times. For this, he is known as a world-class mountaineer. A lengthy career in documentary filmmaking--including the Imax film, <i>Everest</i>--has earned him wide acclaim and four Emmy awards. For this, he is known as one of the elite cinematographers in his field. But his new autobiography, <i>High Exposure: An Enduring Passion for Everest and Other High Places</i>, proves he is more than a climber and a filmmaker; he is also an able writer. <p> Breashears has no lack of good material. We follow him through the stunning backdrops of Yosemite, Europe, Nepal, and Tibet, brushing up against triumphs and tragedies along the way. And while the nuts and bolts of his adventures are entertainment enough, his knack for building suspense and employing understated drama makes his autobiography read like a novel: "The morning was sunny and calm, and Rob looked as though he'd lain down on his side and fallen asleep. Around him the undisturbed snow sparkled in the sun. I stared at his bare left hand ... I wondered what a mountaineer with Rob's experience was doing without a glove." </p><p>Breashears also likes to remind his audience of humble beginnings surmounted: his early climbing days when he was known as "the kid," and a winter he spent sleeping under a sheet of plywood during the Wyoming oil boom when he was called "the worm." But mostly he documents his filmmaking career and climbing passion, both of which he approaches with an obsessive fervor. Readers interested in either pursuit will find <i>High Exposure</i> a fascinating traverse across the spine of the world. <i>--Ben Tiffany</i></p><b>David Breashears</b> has made four trips to Everest's summit. His cinematic achievements include the IMAX� movie <i>Everest</i> and "Everest: The Death Zone" for the PBS series <i>NOVA.</i> He is the recipient of four Emmy awards for his accomplishments in cinematography. When not climbing, Breashears resides in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Francis of Assisi&#39;s Sermon on the Mount: Lessons from the Admonitions</h2><p>Talbot applies the timeless words of St. Francis to our troubled times. In the United States and across the world, we are experiencing polarization, anger, and violence. But God is still in control, and it is important to dig deep into our Christian heritage in a way that speaks to all people. St. Francis is one of the great saints who somehow reaches across all divides, touches hearts and souls, and brings spiritual peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> Talbot explores Francis&#x2019;s <i>Admonitions</i>: twenty-eight teachings that are among the most beautiful and troubling of the saint&#x2019;s writings. Covering sacramental theology of the Eucharist, to communal issues of consecrated life, to very private aspects of faith and devotion, these <i>Admonitions</i> provide clear and radical road signs to the destination on our spiritual journey in Christ.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>John Michael Talbot</b> is a multi-platinum selling, Grammy and Dove award-winning Contemporary Christian Music pioneer.&nbsp; He is recognized as one of Catholic music&#x2019;s most popular artists with compositions published in hymnals throughout the world.

The wisdom of these &#x2018;Franciscan Beatitudes&#x2019; is perennial.&#x201d; &#x2013;<b>Albert Haase, OFM</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Practical Holiness</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Catching Fire Becoming Flame</i><br><br> &#x201c;Saint Francis is the great exemplar of Christian love. He was patient; he was kind. He didn&#x2019;t put on airs. John Michael Talbot helps us to see how a love like Francis&#x2019; might live in a body like mine, wearing clothes like mine, working a job like mine. In short, he shows us how our world and we might find happiness at last." &#x2013;<b>Mike Aquilina</b>, award-winning author of many books, including&nbsp;<i>The Fathers of the Church</i><br><br> "Reading through the pages of "Francis of Assisi's Sermon on the Mount" is a kind of balm for the troubled soul given to the unrelenting and depressing news we are bombarded with each day from here at home and around the world. Unreservedly recommended to the attention of all members of the Christian community, it should be noted that "Francis of Assisi's Sermon on the Mount" is also available for personal reading lists in a digital book format." &#x2014;<i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century</h2><p>Bainton presents the many strands that made up the Reformation in a single, brilliantly coherent account. He discusses the background for Luther&#39;s irreparable breach with the Church and its ramifications for 16th Century Europe, giving thorough accounts of the Diet of Worms, the institution of the Holy Commonwealth of Geneva, Henry VIII&#39;s break with Rome, and William the Silent&#39;s struggle for Dutch independence.</p><p>Roland H. Bainton (1894-1984) was for forty-two years a professor of ecclesiastical history at Yale University, an author, a historian, and an ordained Congregational minister. During his long and distinguished academic career, he lectured across the United States and abroad and wrote more than thirty influential books on Christian history.Would that we had more history like this, so well-proportioned in its emphasis, and so pertinent to the understanding of history now in the making. --<i>The Annals</i> of the American Academy</p><h2>The Last Master Outlaw: How He Outfoxed the FBI Six Times But Not A Cold Case Team</h2><p>In 1971, a skyjacker with a briefcase bomb demanded a $200,000 ransom and a parachute. Then he vanished out the jet&#x2019;s back door and became an instant legend. Now a determined citizen sleuth has assembled a forty-member cold case team, spearheaded by former FBI agents, to solve the mystery of D. B. Cooper. And after a five-year quest, they believe they have succeeded&#x2014;with a fugitive at trail&#x2019;s end. The team&#x2019;s relentless investigation and final confrontation with the mystery man serve as the bookends in The Last Master Outlaw. The subject&#x2019;s astonishing life story as a daredevil fills the remaining chapters, the bulk of which comes from the heartwarming, gut-wrenching accounts of six of his women&#x2014;two former wives; his only sister; a befriended college coed; a &#x201c;getaway gal&#x201d; he met up with during two more FBI escapes, both again involving planes; and a Hollywood producer who was also his cocaine-trade partner. Buckle your seatbelts as this Jekyll-and-Hyde ladies&#x2019; man travels through five countries, utilizing more than a dozen identities, wigs, and fake mustaches while engaging in a half-dozen careers and raising three families. Then be a witness as the cornered chameleon is forced to face the truth in front of the cameras of a dogged cold case team, which was armed and ready for any eventuality.</p><p><b>Thomas J.

It never won a broad following, but it was and is a critical favorite. Barnaby revolved around a precocious five-year-old named Barnaby Baxter and his fairy godfather Jackeen J. O&#x2019;Malley. Yet O&#x2019;Malley, a cigar-chomping, bumbling con-artist and fast-talker, was not your typical protector. His grasp of magic was specious at best, limited to occasional flashes, and often aided and abetted by his fellow members in The Elves, Leprechauns, Gnomes, and Little Men&#x2019;s Chowder &amp; Marching Society. This five-volume Barnaby series will collect the entirety of the original newspaper strips from 1942-1952. Barnaby Vol. 1 will collect all the strips from 1942 and 1943.</p><p><p><strong>Crockett Johnson</strong> was the pen name of cartoonist and children&#x2019;s book illustrator David Johnson Leisk (October 20,1906&#x2013;July 11, 1975). He is best known for the Harold series of books, which began with <em>Harold and the Purple Crayon</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and for the comic strip <em>Barnaby</em>. He was married to the children&#x2019;s book author Ruth Krauss, with whom he collaborated on several books, including <em>The Carrot Seed</em>.</p><p><strong>Daniel Clowes</strong> is a celebrated graphic novelist, Academy-Award nominated screenwriter, and frequent cover artist for the <em>New Yorker</em>. He lives in Oakland, CA. He is a multi-Harvey, Eisner, and Ignatz Award winner, and his papers were recently acquired by the University of Chicago library.</p><p><strong>Eric Reynolds</strong> is the Associate Publisher of Fantagraphics Books and lives in Seattle, WA.</p>Gr 5 Up&#x2013;Originally published as a daily newspaper strip, albeit in small circulation, this collection introduces the daily expostulations and exasperations of preschooler Barnaby Baxter and his rotund, inappropriate fairy godfather. Mr. J.J. O'Malley uses his cigar as his magic wand and has a host of acquaintances from the magic world that casually abuts our own: a prankster leprechaun, a morose ghost, and other members of the Elves, Leprechauns, Gnomes, and Little Men's Chowder and Marching Society. The adventures are very much of the time in which they were written, with references to wartime rationing, scrap-metal drives, and machine politics, as well as many casual pop-culture allusions that may escape today's readers, but the chatty glossary at the back will help. The artwork is redolent of the ligne claire school, with little shading and with a slight stiffness to the characters' positioning. The humor can be a slow burn, immune to the gag-a-day requirements of many newspaper strips, with a cumulative effect causing an unexpectedly familiar chuckle every few pages and a sense of delight as the ever-expanding cast comes together en masse. Highly verbal and quietly unexpected, the strip is a clear antecedent of the sort of comic situations experienced by Calvin and Hobbes&#x2013;and the visuals predict Johnson's own Harold with his purple crayon, but with a peculiar picaresque aggregation as each story line tumbles almost imperceptibly into the next chaotic chapter. Cleverly absurd, with solid contextual reference material to aid readers.&#x2013;Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

She joined forces with the detective on that case, Edna Hendershot, and the two soon discovered they were dealing with a serial rapist: a man who photographed his victims, threatening to release the images online, and whose calculated steps to erase all physical evidence suggested he might be a soldier or a cop. Through meticulous police work the detectives would eventually connect the rapist to other attacks in Colorado&#x2014;and beyond.<br><br>Based on investigative files and extensive interviews with the principals, <i>Unbelievable </i>is a serpentine tale of doubt, lies, and a hunt for justice, unveiling the disturbing truth of how sexual assault is investigated today&#x2014;and the long history of skepticism toward rape victims.&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Previously published as<i>&nbsp;A False Report</i></b></p><p><b>T.

Martin Meredith captures the colours and textures of the land and brings to life the extraordinary figures who peopled it and whose influence lingers on. His descriptions of Rhodes and Kruger, of Robinson and Barnato and all the other actors, rogues and heroes of this epic drama played out upon the scorched African veldt are filled with fascinating insights and rich with anecdotes which bring them bursting from these pages.

Later, her deepening interest in Jewish history and culture was expressed in such powerful poems as &#x201c;1492,&#x201d; &#x201c;The New Ezekiel,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Guardian of the Red Disk.&#x201d; Influenced both by American models, among them her poetic mentor Emerson, and by the poets whose work she translated, including Heinrich Heine and the medieval Hebrew poets Solomon Ibn Gabirol and Judah ha-Levi, she forged a poetic style of high technical accomplishment and moral passion.<br><br>Long neglected, her work is revealed in this volume as an important contribution to American poetry.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>John Hollander</b>&nbsp;(1929&#x2013;2013) published nearly two dozen books of poetry, including&nbsp;<i>Selected Poetry</i>&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;<i>Figurehead</i>(1999), and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Draft of Light</i>&nbsp;(2008), as well as five books of criticism.

It began in the great urban centers of Central Asia, Bukhara and Samarkand; and for centuries it dominated the high culture of Central Asia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Anatolia, and the whole of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent under the Mughal Empire. It has been composed by saints and rou�s, kings and beggars. It has been written in gold, poets have had their mouths stuffed with precious gems for an apt line of poetry, and the uncivilized have measured their progress into civilization by their ability to quote Persian poetry. A Millennium Of Classical Persian Poetry is designed to introduce students of Persian to the richness of the classical poetic legacy. The Persian metrical system and poetic forms are explained, and selections are given from the works of all major poets, from Rudaki in the tenth century to Bahar in the twentieth, with annotations of difficult grammatical constructions and unfamiliar allusions. Highlights include poetry by Firdawsi, Farrukhi, Anvari, Khaqani, Nizami, Attar, Rumi, Sa&#x2018;di, Hafiz, Jami, Sa&#x2019;ib, and a host of lesser-known poets. A full Persian-English vocabulary is included.</p><p>Wheeler M.

Although characterized in the surviving sources and modern studies as a predominantly mercantile state, Carthage fought many wars, both aggressive and defensive, before and in between the contests with the Roman parvenus. The Greek states of Sicily, above all Syracuse under its tyrants Dionysius the Great and then Agathocles, were her most resolute opponents, but in North Africa itself, in Sardinia, and later on in Spain she won&#x2014;and sometimes lost&#x2014;major wars. This is the first full-length study dedicated to these other wars which furthered Carthage&#x2019;s interests for over half a millennium. The book is based firmly and analytically on the ancient sources, and among many insights is that Carthage, though usually considered a naval power, did more fighting on land than at sea and with more success.</p><p>Dexter Hoyos has recently retired as Associate Professor of Classics at Sydney University.

Drawing on communications from the spirits of more than 100 'successful' suicides, it offers an intriguing look at what the dead themselves say about suicide, its repercussions, and their experiences in the afterlife. Bringing together the channeled messages of three types of suicide&#x2014;traditional suicide, assisted suicide, and the suicide mass murder adopted by terrorists&#x2014;the book covers a wide range of topics, including why people commit suicide, what it is like to cross over, adjustment problems, what suicides would say to those left behind, and what they would tell others thinking of taking their own lives. Additionally, the book conveys powerful messages from suicide bombers, warning potential terrorists of the serious karmic consequences that await them. For anyone contemplating suicide or euthanasia, the book offers profound, sometimes unsettling, insight into the ramifications of these acts.</p><p>This book grew out of an experience Dr. Klimo had working with a suicidal client who wanted to know what might happen to her if she killed herself. The idea is to provide a "best guess" of what the channeled/NDE/hypnotherapy material says could happen. It represents about 2 years worth of research, culling massive amounts of material for relevant information and figuring out a way to organize it that made sense. In the end, we spent (literally) thousands of dollars in copyright permission fees to be able to allow readers to see for themselves what has been said and how we came to our conclusions. It is referenced so that if people want to read more they can find the original source,s and do so. However, unlike our other book, this one does not have an index. Two chapters are particularly important to us: "Messages to the Suicidal" (know what you are getting into before you do it) and "Messages to Those Left Behind" (with the hope if can lead to some healing or forgiveness).<br><br>The question mark in the title is deliberate. Do we know the answers for sure? No. All we can do is present the range of what is said from those who claim to know and indicate the patterns as they present themselves. Our hope is that this may help shed light on the topic and, just perhaps, help people to make better informed decisions.Jon Klimo, Ph.D., is an associate professor of psychology at the American Schools of Professional Psychology (ASPP) at Argosy University in California.

D. Lenzen shows how to tie knots like no others. Just as origami figurines are created through the merging of different folding techniques, he creates new knots by combining historical knot elements and new knotting techniques. The product of this intermingling is what he calls a fusion knot -- a brand new genre of knot in a centuries-old tradition. It is rare for a knot book to feature even one brand new, never-before-seen knot, but <i>Decorative Fusion Knots</i> features more than 20 brand-new knots created by the author. <i>Decorative Fusion Knots</i> is the culmination of ten years of study, practice, and creation. The knots within were inspired by history, nature, mythology, and more. Many of these incredible knots have never been presented or described publicly, until now. Never before has a knot book presented a step-by-step format to tying brand new knots like this in full-color. Alongside fusion knots, this book presents logical and comprehensive instructions for a plethora of historical knots, including Celtic knots, Chinese decorative knots, maritime knots, and popular paracord ties. Each historical knot instruction is presented in step-by-step fashion. Each of the 600 step-by-step color photographs is accompanied with clear, concise instructional captions. Whether you're a sailor, teacher, jewelry maker, survivalist, general knot enthusiast, or just looking for bush crafts, paracord ties, a curriculum for students, or a fun way to pass the time, <i>Decorative Fusion Knots</i> is the book for you. With easy-to-understand captions and clear step-by-step photos, readers can learn at their own pace, review whole techniques at a single glance and simply lay the book flat on the table and follow along as they tie.</p><p>J.D. Lenzen is the creator of the highly acclaimed YouTube channel "Tying It All Together", and the producer of over 200 instructional videos. He's been formally recognized by the International Guild of Knot Tyers (IGKT) for his contributions to knotting, and is the originator of <i>Fusion Knotting</i>--innovative knots created through the merging of different knot elements and knotting techniques.</p><h2>Second Violin: An Inspector Troy Thriller (The Inspector Troy Novels, 6)</h2><p>One of today&#x2019;s top historical espionage writers, considered as good as Le Carr�&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) and a master&#x201d; (<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>), John Lawton adds another spellbinding thriller to his Inspector Troy series with <i>Second Violin</i>. The sixth installment in the series, Lawton&#x2019;s new novel opens in 1938 with Europe on the brink of war. In London, Frederick Troy, newly promoted to the prestigious murder squad at Scotland Yard, is put in charge of rounding up a list of German and Italian enemy aliens&#x201d; that also includes Frederick&#x2019;s brother, Rod, who learns upon receiving an internment letter that he was born in Austria despite having grown up in England. Hundreds of men are herded by train to a neglected camp on the Isle of Man. And as the bombs start falling on London, a murdered rabbi is found, then another, and another. Amid great war, murder is what matters. Moving from the Nazi-infested alleys of prewar Vienna to the bombed-out streets of 1940 London, and featuring an extraordinary cast of characters, Lawton&#x2019;s latest thriller is a suspenseful and intelligent novel, as good a spy story as it is an historical narrative.</p><p>John Lawton worked for Channel 4 for many years, and, among many others, produced Harold Pinter&#39;s &#39;O Superman&#39;, the least-watched most-argued-over programme of the 90s. He has written seven novels in his Troy series, two Joe Wilderness novels, the standalone Sweet Sunday, a couple of short stories and the occasional essay. He writes very slowly and almost entirely on the hoof in the USA or Italy, but professes to be a resident of a tiny village in the Derbyshire Peak District. He admires the work of Barbara Gowdy, TC Boyle, Oliver Bleeck, Franz Schubert and Clara Schumann - and is passionate about the playing of Maria Joao Pires. He has no known hobbies, belongs to no organisations and hates being photographed.Lawton's engrossing sixth entry but the first chronologically in his Inspector Troy thriller series (<i>Black Out</i>, etc.) chronicles the major events leading up to WWII--Germany's annexation of Austria, Chamberlain's peace efforts, <i>Kristallnacht</i>--while providing a disturbing picture of anti-Semitism and class frictions in England at the time. As part of Scotland Yard's murder squad, Insp. Frederick Troy investigates a series of slayings of London rabbis, but various subplots equally intrigue, notably one that unfolds in an internment camp for Germans, Jews and foreigners--including Troy's Austrian-born brother, Rod--rounded up after Britain's entry into the war. At one point, Troy and a lady friend discover the "aphrodisia of war" in Hyde Park, a spot popular with couples for copulation during the blitz. Lawton does a fine job of incorporating such lesser known period details into his saga, though some readers may find he relies too often on deus ex machina for their taste. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A fable for modern times, it is a fairy tale that&#x2019;s not about rescuing the princess, saving the kingdom, or fighting the ultimate war between Good and Evil &#x2015; but about being a hero in your own home. The opening chapter tells the origin of the castle itself, which is abandoned by its princess in a comic twist on &#x201c;Sleeping Beauty&#x201d; when she rides off into the sunset with her Prince Charming. The castle becomes a refuge for misfits, outcasts, and others seeking sanctuary, playing host to a lively and colorful cast of characters that inhabits the subsequent stories, including a talking anthropomorphic horse, a mysteriously pregnant Lady on the run, and a bearded nun. Linda Medley lavishly illustrates <em>Castle Waiting</em> in a classic visual style reminiscent of Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson. Blending elements from a variety of sources &#x2015; fairy tales, folklore, nursery rhymes &#x2015; Medley tells the story of the everyday lives of fantastic characters with humor, intelligence, and insight into human nature. <em>Castle Waiting</em> can be read on multiple levels and can be enjoyed by readers of all ages, especially young girls.</p><p>Linda Medley lives in Portland, OR, where she is currently working on the Castle Waiting series.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;With its quiet blend of fantasy, folktales, and character-driven storytelling, this charming collection brings the first 12 issues of an Eisner Award-winning comic-book series to a wider audience. It opens with The Brambly Hedge, which gives the origin of the castle itself. In a comic retelling of Sleeping Beauty, a medieval castle and its loving inhabitants are abandoned when the princess wakes up, finds her Prince Charming, and rides off into the sunset with him. The castle transforms into an outpost of sorts for the unusual, the unwanted, and those just needing a place to hide from the world. Talking chivalrous horses, pregnant mothers on the run, and nuns who were once bearded ladies in the circus are just a few of the colorful inhabitants whose stories fill the remainder of the volume. Medleys storytelling becomes more assured and complex as the series progresses, and she uses flashbacks and stories-within-stories in a manner that creates a rhythm that is both fun and gripping. Hard-edged lines with simple forms create black-and-white artwork that melds nicely with the fairy-tale feel of the stories. This volume is accessible for younger readers but filled with enough layers and depth to satisfy those looking for a bit more sophistication.<i>&#x2013;Matthew L.

When it&#x2019;s time, he&#x2019;ll tell them about the miracle.</p><p>It was the dawn of the new millennium, he&#x2019;ll say. I was living in the Midwest back then, but my friends from college persuaded me to come to New York.</p><p>I arrived a few days ahead of the amazing occasion, and all over the city there was an atmosphere of feverish anticipation. The year two thousand! The new millennium! Some people thought it was sure to be the end of the world. Others thought we were at the threshold of something completely new and better. The tabloids carried wild predictions from celebrity clairvoyants, and even people who scoffed and said that the date was an arbitrary and meaningless one were secretly agitated. In short, we were suddenly aware of ourselves standing there, staring at the future blindfolded.</p><p>I suppose, looking back on it, that all the commotion seems comical and ridiculous. And perhaps you&#x2019;re thinking that we churned it up to entertain ourselves because we were bored or because our lives felt too easy&#x2014;trivial and mundane. But consider: ceremonial occasions, even purely personal ones like birthdays or anniversaries, remind us that the world is full of terrifying surprises and no one knows what even the very next second will bring!</p><p>Well, shortly before the momentous day, a strange news item appeared: experts were saying that a little mistake had been made&#x2014;just one tiny mistake, a little detail in the way computers everywhere had been programmed. But the consequences of this detail, the experts said, were potentially disastrous; tiny as it was, the detail might affect everybody, and in a very big way!</p><p>You see, if history has anything to teach us, it&#x2019;s that&#x2014;despite all our efforts, despite our best (or worst) intentions, despite our touchingly indestructible faith in our own foresight&#x2014;we poor humans cannot actually think ahead; there are just too many variables. And so, when it comes down to it, it always turns out that no one is in charge of the things that really matter.</p><p>It must be hard for you to imagine&#x2014;it&#x2019;s even hard for me to remember&#x2014;but people hadn&#x2019;t been using computers for very long. As far as I know, my mother (your great-grandmother) never even touched one! And no one had thought to inform the computers that one day the universe would pass from the years of the one thousands into the years of the two thousands. So the machines, as these experts suddenly realized, were not equipped to understand that at the conclusion of 1999 time would not start over from 1900, time would keep going.</p><p>People all over America&#x2014;all over the world!&#x2014;began to speak of "a crisis of major proportions" (which was a phrase we used to use back then). Because, all the routine operations that we&#x2019;d so blithely delegated to computers, the operations we all took for granted and depended on&#x2014;how would they proceed?</p><p>Might one be fatally trapped in an elevator? Would we have to huddle together for warmth and scrabble frantically through our pockets for a pack of fancy restaurant matches so we could set our stacks of old New York Reviews ablaze? Would all the food rot in heaps out there on the highways, leaving us to pounce on fat old street rats and grill them over the fames? What was going to happen to our bank accounts&#x2014;would they vaporize? And what about air traffic control? On December 31 when the second hand moved from 11:59:59 to midnight, would all the airplanes in the sky collide?</p><p>Everyone was thinking of more and more alarming possibilities. Some people committed their last night on this earth to partying, and others rushed around buying freeze-dried provisions and cases of water and flashlights and radios and heavy blankets in the event that the disastrous problem might somehow eventually be solved.</p><p>And then, as the clock ticked its way through the enormous gatherings in celebration of the era that was due to begin in a matter of hours, then minutes, then seconds, we waited to learn the terrible consequences of the tiny oversight. Khartoum, Budapest, Paris&#x2014;we watched on television, our hearts fluttering, as midnight, first just a tiny speck in the east, unfurled gently, darkening the sky and moving toward us over the globe.</p><p>But the amazing thing, Nathaniel will tell his grandchildren, was that nothing happened! We held our breath . . . And there was nothing! It was a miracle. Over the face of the earth, from east to west and back again, nothing catastrophic happened at all.</p><p>Oh, well. Frankly, by the time he or any of his friends get around to producing a grandchild (or even a child, come to think of it) they might well have to explain what computers had been.

Parris has constructed a splendid, unputdownable whodunnit.</p> <p>In 1583, England was approaching one of the greatest crises in its history. Queen Elizabeth, excommunicated by the Pope for her refusal to return the Church of England to Rome, was under threat from all the Catholic powers. Her spymaster Francis Walsingham had his own army of informers searching for conspiracies against the English crown. Everyone was on the lookout for trouble.</p> <p>Yet in May of that year, amongst the quiet and dreaming spires of Oxford University, a public debate took place that was nothing short of revolutionary.</p> <p>On one side, John Underhill, an unpopular figure, forced upon Lincoln College as their Rector by his powerful patron the Earl of Leicester. On the other, Giordano Bruno, a wandering Italian scholar-monk, in trouble with the Inquisition, and in the story (and probably in fact) serving Walsingham as an anti-Catholic informer.</p> <p>But what is truly amazing about Bruno is that he believed not like Copernicus and Galileo that the Sun and not the Earth was the center of the universe, but that the cosmos did not have a center at all. The stars in the sky, he claimed, were other suns, seen from vast distances, quite likely with their own planets, in an infinite space. In short, this monk-philosopher was a modern man. Sadly, he lost the Oxford debate.</p> <p>Against this well-researched background of real events Parris has added a few characters, including Underhill's lovely and educated daughter Sophia, whose presence in Lincoln College seems a happy invention. On the eve of the debate there is a murder in the college. Then another. And another. Sophia disappears. A Catholic conspiracy seems to be afoot. Also a romance. As the plot thickens, I was absolutely gripped, nor did I even guess at the ending until it came.</p> <p>The descriptions of Elizabethan Oxford are wonderfully atmospheric and vivid. The characters are believable and sympathetic. The plot is fast-paced. But there is also a subtle message for us about the human condition. Just twice, the author allows her characters to make use of modern words--"paranoid" and "propaganda"--in their reported speech. This isn't a mistake. Parris knows exactly what she is doing. She is gently reminding us, almost subliminally, that Bruno and Sophia--and who knows how many other of our ancestors--were actually modern people like ourselves, with free minds, trapped in a dangerous medieval world. <em>--Edward Rutherfurd</em></p> <p>(Photo � Jeanne Masoero)</p> <strong>"Discovering Giordano Bruno: A Note on My Research" by S.J. Parris</strong> <br> <p>I first encountered the character of Giordano Bruno when I was a student at the University of Cambridge writing a thesis about the influence of occult philosophy on Renaissance literature. I was immediately captivated by his multi-faceted career (philosopher, proto-scientist, magician, and poet) and the drama of his life during years of exile on the run from the Inquisition around the courts of Europe. All the accounts I read of him suggested that he was extremely charismatic, the sort of person everyone wanted at their dinner parties, and that he possessed the ability to offend and charm in equal measure--in the course of a few years he went from fugitive heretic to close friend and confidant of kings and courtiers. But he was also a man fiercely committed to his ideas, even when that meant deliberately provoking the received wisdom of the day and courting a death sentence from the Pope.</p> <p>At the time I thought Bruno would make an intriguing character for a novel, but other ideas intervened and for a while I forgot about him. More than ten years later, I was reading about the Wars of Religion in the late 16th century and came across his name again in a book that suggested that Bruno had added the profession of spy to his already crowded resum�, providing intelligence to Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth&#x2019;s spymaster, from inside the French embassy where Bruno lived during his time in England. At the time, the English court was rife with rumors of plots to assassinate Queen Elizabeth with the blessing of the Pope and the backing of Europe&#x2019;s two great Catholic powers, France and Spain, in order to replace her with the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, thus bringing England back under the influence of Rome.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d always been fascinated by this complex period of history, where religious and personal allegiance was in a constant state of flux and no one, including the Queen and her Council, quite knew who to trust. When I discovered the theory that Bruno had been a spy, I knew I had the material for my story. I chose to begin the series with Bruno&#x2019;s real-life visit to Oxford in the spring of 1583; it was on this trip that he came into contact with many of the influential figures of the court, including Philip Sidney. Bruno hated his time in Oxford and wrote very unfavorably of it; I tried to fill in the gaps and imagine what might have befallen him there to make him take against the university so vehemently.</p> <p>Oxford (both the university and the town) provided a perfect setting for my novel. It was a significant hub for clandestine Catholic activity during the 1580s and 1590s, and an Oxford college is a closed community, the perfect setting for the classic murder mystery. I&#x2019;ve loved detective fiction since I was a teenager and wanted to try my hand at writing one of my own. I spent a bit of time in Oxford, and I was shown around Lincoln College by the present Rector. Fortunately the late sixteenth century left behind a rich trove of documents and records, so there are a number of very thorough biographies and histories of the period available, which made it very easy to research.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy reading Heresy as much as I enjoyed researching and writing it. <em>--S.J.

He regarded this undertaking&#x2014;to &#x201c;write the Indian version of our own true ways in our history and legends,&#x201d; as he puts it&#x2014;as both a corrective and an instructive tool. Bullchild culled this remarkable collection of historical legends from his memory of the oral history as it was passed down to him by his elders and by seeking out the oral traditions of other tribes. These stories, like all legends, Bullchild reminds us, &#x201c;may sound a little foolish, but they are very true. And they have much influence over all of the people of this world, even now as we all live.&#x201d; Woody Kipp provides a preface for this Bison Books edition.</p><p>Percy Bullchild was a well-known musician, artist, and storyteller.

As is characteristic of all of Bank's works, these stories resonate with irony and compassion, honesty and insight, extending into the vast territory of the heart and the world, from working-class New England to Florida and the Caribbean and Africa. Broad in scope and rich in imagination, <em>The Angel on the Roof</em> affirms Russell Banks's place as one of the masters of American storytelling.</p><p>Russell Banks (<i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>, <i>Affliction</i>) started out as a poet, and nowhere is this more evident than in his 37 years' worth of exquisite short stories, collected here in one hefty volume for the first time. In a mournfully lyrical phrase, he can evoke his characteristic landscape, the icy northeastern U.S.: "The air was crystalline, almost absent. The fields lay like aged plates of bone--dry, scoured by the cold until barren of possibility, incapable even of decomposition." Though his stories venture to Jamaica and Africa, Banks keeps coming back to New Hampshire and the themes of divorce, poverty, violence, and what he calls "the old father-and-son thing." He's not slumming in his trailer-park tales: his own drunken prole father beat him brutally, and Banks knows how grief and guilt shatter and unite families and small towns. <p> Characters often crop up in more than one story, giving the setting novelistic depth, drawing us into each life. In "Queen for a Day," we meet the young children of the Painter clan of New Hampshire as their dad is abandoning their mom, who then loses her job. "They run to her and wrap her in their arms... the three of them wind around each other like snakes moving in and out of one another's coils." In "Firewood," Painter's grown children rebuff his offer of fuel for their hearth, repaying his indifference, and Banks gives us a bad-guy's-eye view of their shared loneliness. In "The Fisherman," a $50,000 lottery is won by an old ice fisherman who stashes it in a cigar box, eliciting character-revealing reactions from the trailer-park denizens. "Dis Bwoy, Him Gwan" further reveals why the local pothead Bruce Severance so urgently needs the fisherman's money. The stories resonate and illuminate each other, the dialogue is pitch-perfect, and the collection has the cohesiveness of a 500-page novel. Banks's prose has the stark grace of classical tragedy. He's a poet after all. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><p>"Banks has the kind of God-given talent that lets him not so much invent characters as inhabit the heads of people who already exist.-- The writing is--as immediate as [the] morning headlines." --The Montreal Gazette</p> <p>"As often as Banks gives them (his characters) dignity, he also dishes out pain. The Angel on the Roof doesn't offer balm, just honesty. These hard truths are what make the book shine." - Calgary Herald</p> <p>"...yet Banks is also a compassionate writer, illuminating even the most despicable characters with flashes of sorrowful understanding."<br>- The National Post</p> <p>"These stories perch on the rim of memory, that shadowy realm that makes Banks' novels like Rule of the Bone, so powerful--we [are] blessed by Banks' prodigious talent and insight." - Los Angeles Times Book Review, June 11 2000-06-28</p></p><h2>French Country Cooking</h2><p>First published sixty years ago while food rationing was still in force, Elizabeth David used this book to introduce to the nation&#x2019;s bland palate, ingredients and recipes previously undiscovered in postwar Britain. Many people of that era had never experienced anything other than British cooking &#x2013; meat, two veg and a nice steamed pudding. She starts by setting the record straight: &#x2018;Those who care to look for it will find the justification of France&#x2019;s culinary reputation in the provinces, at the riverside inns, in unknown caf�s...in sea port bistros...and nowadays in caf�s routiers, the lorry-drivers&#x2019; restaurants. In such places the most interesting food of France is to be found.&#x2019; From having lived with a French family while studying over there, she was able to bring firsthand knowledge to this short yet concise guide to provincial French cooking.<br><br>She starts with a chapter on the Batterie de Cuisine. But it&#x2019;s the collection of regional recipes that follow that made this book such a treat for 1950s Britain; divided into sections on soups, fish, eggs, luncheon, supper and family dishes, meat, poultry, game, vegetables, salads, sauces and sweets, she gives an entertaining and informative introduction to each.<br><br>French Country Cooking reveals the immense diversity of the cuisine through recipes that range from a primitive peasant soup of the Basque country to the refined Lyonnaise dish of Poulet � la Cr�me. To those used to the traditional format of recipe writing the book will come as something of a surprise since Elizabeth David weaves the ingredients into the methods complete with details of the region, tradition and people. Elizabeth David&#x2019;s acclaimed writings are often cited as an inspiration by many of today&#x2019;s leading chefs, as well as home cooks, and are essential to any serious cookery book collection.</p><p><b>Elizabeth David&nbsp;</b>(1913-1992) was a legendary writer and cook. In 1950, she published&nbsp;<i>Mediterranean Food</i>&nbsp;and along with subsequent books, including&nbsp;<i>Italian Food&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>French Provincial Cooking</i>,&nbsp;changed the face of cookery in Britain for ever. In her later works she explored the traditions of English cooking and is widely considered Britain's greatest twentieth-century cookery writer. Her books continue to inspire many today, who find her philosophy of simplicity, authenticity, knowledge and care to their liking. She received a CBE in 1986.&#34;&#39;A remarkable book.... food is treated with reverence, with understanding and, above all, with care&#39; - Sunday Times&#34;</p><h2>The Downtown Pop Underground: New York City and the literary punks, renegade artists, DIY filmmakers, mad playwrights, and rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll glitter queens who revolutionized culture</h2><p>The 1960s to early &#x2019;70s was a pivotal time for American culture, and New York City was ground zero for seismic shifts in music, theater, art, and filmmaking. The Downtown Pop Underground takes a kaleidoscopic tour of Manhattan during this era and shows how deeply interconnected all the alternative worlds and personalities were that flourished in the basement theaters, dive bars, concert halls, and dingy tenements within one square mile of each other. Author Kembrew McLeod links the artists, writers, and performers who created change, and while some of them didn&#x2019;t become everyday names, others, like Patti Smith, Andy Warhol, and Debbie Harry, did become icons. Ambitious in scope and scale, the book is fueled by the actual voices of many of the key characters who broke down the entrenched divisions between high and low, gay and straight, and art and commerce&#x2014;and changed the cultural landscape of not just the city but the world.</p><p><b>Kembrew McLeod</b> is an award-winning author of several books whose writing has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Rolling Stone, Slate</i>, and <i>Salon</i>. A professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa, he is the recipient of a recent NEH Public Scholar fellowship to support this project.&#x201c;McLeod&#x2019;s deft and generous book tells of a constellation of avant-garde squatters, divas, and dissidents who reinvented the world&#x2014;a story which comes to seem more improbable the more meticulously he records it.

Everything about this town reminded me of why the hell I&#x2019;d wanted to get away. I had a life in Tuscaloosa, and I needed that life to escape. Here, I was Marcus Hardy. No matter where I went, people knew me. They knew my family. And now . . . they were talking about my family. Which is why I had come home. Leaving my sister and mother here to face this alone was impossible. The scandal hovering over our heads took away all my choices and my freedom. Right now few people knew, but it was only a matter of time. Soon the entire coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama, would know what my dad was doing&#x2014;or should I say, who my dad was doing. King of the Mercedes car dealerships along the Gulf Coast had been a high enough title for some little gold-digging whore only a few years older than me to jump into bed with my dear ol&#x2019; dad. The one time I&#x2019;d seen the home wrecker working behind the desk right outside Dad&#x2019;s office, I&#x2019;d known something wasn&#x2019;t right. She was young and smoking hot and apparently money hungry.<br> <br>Dad couldn&#x2019;t keep it in his pants, and now my mom and sister would have to deal with the stigma it would cause. People would feel sorry for my mom. This was already devastating to her, and she didn&#x2019;t even know yet that the other woman was barely a woman. My younger sister, Amanda, had caught them going at it late one evening when Mom had sent her over to the office to take Dad some dinner. She&#x2019;d called me that night crying hysterically. I&#x2019;d withdrawn from school, packed my things, and headed home. There was no other option. My family needed me.<br> <br>A knock at the door snapped me out of my internal tirade, and I went to see what chick was here looking for Cage this time. God knew the guy had an endless line of females parading through his life. My new roommate was a player. A major player. He put my best friend, Preston, to shame. I twisted the knob and swung the door open without peeking through the hole.<br> <br>The surprise was on me. I&#x2019;d been prepared to tell whatever tall, willowy, large-but-obviously-fake-chested female dressed in almost nothing waiting outside the door that Cage was busy with another one very similar to her. Except a very natural, almost curvy redhead stood before me. Red-rimmed eyes and a tear-streaked face gazed up at me. There were no mascara lines running down her face. Her hair wasn&#x2019;t styled, but pulled back in a ponytail. She wore jeans and what appeared to be an authentic Back in Black AC/DC concert T-shirt. No belly button drawing attention to a flat, tanned stomach, and her clothes weren&#x2019;t skintight. Well, maybe the jeans were a little snug, but they hugged her hips nicely. My appreciation of her legs in the slim-fit jeans stopped, however, when I noticed the small beat-up suitcase clutched tightly in her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Cage here?&#x201d; Her voice sounded broken and musical at the same time. I was having a hard time digesting that this girl was here for Cage. She wasn&#x2019;t anything like he veered toward. Nothing was enhanced. Everything from her thick dark-copper hair to the Chuck Taylors on her feet screamed &#x201c;not Cage&#x2019;s type.&#x201d; And the fact that she was carrying a suitcase&#x2014;well, that couldn&#x2019;t be good.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, um, no.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her shoulders slumped and another sob escaped her. One small, dainty hand flew up in an attempt to mute the sound of her obvious distress. Her nails were even classy. Not too long, with a smooth, rounded tip and soft pink nail polish.<br> <br>&#x201c;I left my cell phone&#x201d;&#x2014;she let out a sigh, then continued&#x2014;&#x201c;at my sister&#x2019;s. I need to call him. Can I come in?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cage was out with a swimsuit model who apparently had a thing for college baseball players. I knew from the way he talked he didn&#x2019;t intend to come up for air much tonight. He&#x2019;d never answer her call, and I hated to see her get more upset than she already was. A horrible thought crossed my mind: Surely he hadn&#x2019;t gotten this girl pregnant. Couldn&#x2019;t he see how freaking innocent she was?<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, yeah, but I don&#x2019;t know if he&#x2019;ll answer. He&#x2019;s busy . . . tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shot me a sour smile and nodded, stepping around me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know the kind of busy he is, but he&#x2019;ll talk to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She sounded rather confident. I wasn&#x2019;t feeling her confidence myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have a cell I can use?&#x201d;<br> <br>I reached into the pocket of my jeans and handed it to her, unable to argue with her further. She had stopped crying and I wanted to keep it that way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll try calling first.&#x201d;<br> <br>I watched as she walked over to the sofa and dropped her suitcase to the floor with a thunk before sinking dejectedly down onto the worn cushions as if she&#x2019;d been here a hundred times. Being as I&#x2019;d only been moved in for two days, I wouldn&#x2019;t know if she had been here before or not. Cage was a friend of a friend who had been looking for a roommate. I&#x2019;d needed somewhere to live fast and his place was nice. Preston was on the same baseball team as Cage at the local community college. Once Preston heard I needed a place to live, he&#x2019;d called Cage and hooked me up.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me. I left my phone when I ran. You&#x2019;re not here, but your new roommate let me in. Call me.&#x201d; She sniffed, then hung up. I watched, fascinated, as she proceeded to text him. She really believed the male whore I lived with was going to call her right up as soon as he got her message. I was intrigued and growing more concerned by the minute.<br> <br>She finished and handed the phone back to me. A smile touched her splotchy red face and two dimples appeared in her cheeks. Damn, that was cute.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks. Do you mind if I wait a little bit until he calls back?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head,. &#x201c;No, not at all. You want a drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>She nodded and stood up. &#x201c;Yes, but I&#x2019;ll get it. My drinks are in the bottom drawer of the fridge behind the Bud Lights.&#x201d;<br> <br>I frowned and followed her into the kitchen. She opened the fridge and bent down to get her hidden drink. With her bent over digging for her so-called drink, the snug fit of the faded jeans over her ass was hard to miss. It was a perfect heart shape, and although she wasn&#x2019;t very tall, her legs seemed to go on for miles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, here it is. Cage needs to run to the store and restock. He must be letting his one-nighters drink my Jarritos.&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t keep guessing. I needed to know who she was exactly. Surely she wasn&#x2019;t one of his girlfriends. Could she be the sister Preston had mentioned dating? I sure as hell hoped not. I was interested, and I hadn&#x2019;t been interested in anyone in a while. Not since the last girl broke my heart. I&#x2019;d opened my mouth to ask her how she knew Cage when the phone in my pocket started ringing. She walked over to me and held out her hand. The girl really believed it was Cage. I glanced down, but sure enough, my roommate had called back.<br> <br>She took the phone from my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s such a selfish jerk.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay there, Cage.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to leave my phone. I was just upset.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, your new roommate&#x2019;s a nice guy. He&#x2019;s been very helpful.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t end your date. Get her out of your system. I&#x2019;ll wait.<br> <br>&#x201c;I promise not to go back.<br> <br>&#x201c;She is who she is, Cage.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just hate her.&#x201d; I could hear the tears in her voice again.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, really, I&#x2019;m fine. I just needed to see you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll leave.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cage&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cage.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>She held the phone out to me. &#x201c;He wants to talk to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>This conversation was nothing like I&#x2019;d expected. The girl had to be his sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen, I need you to make sure Low stays there until I can get home. She&#x2019;s upset and I don&#x2019;t want her leaving. Get her one of her damn Mexican soda thingies out of the fridge. They&#x2019;re behind the Bud Lights in the bottom drawer. I have to hide them from other chicks I have over. All females tend to like those nasty drinks. Turn on the television, distract her, whatever. I&#x2019;m only ten minutes away, but I&#x2019;m putting my jeans on as we speak and headed home. Just help her get her mind off things, but don&#x2019;t touch her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, okay, sure. Is she your sister?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cage chuckled into the phone. &#x201c;Hell no, she ain&#x2019;t my sister. I&#x2019;d never buy my damn sister drinks and call her back when I&#x2019;m in the middle of a fucking threesome. Low&#x2019;s the girl I&#x2019;m gonna marry.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had no response to that. My eyes found her standing over by the window with her back to me. The long thick copper locks curled on the ends and brushed against the middle of her back. She was absolutely nothing like the girls Cage regularly hooked up with. What did he mean, she was the girl he was going to marry? That made no sense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep her there, man. I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he hung up the phone.<br> <br>I dropped it on the table and stood there staring at her back. She turned around slowly and studied me a moment, and then a smile broke across her face.<br> <br>&#x201c;He told you he was going to marry me, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; she said laughing softly before taking a drink of the orange soda with what appeared to have Spanish writing on the label.<br> <br>&#x201c;Crazy boy. I shouldn&#x2019;t have bothered him, but he&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d;<br> <br>She walked over and sank back down onto the old faded green sofa, pulling her legs up underneath her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m not leaving. He&#x2019;d rip apart my sister&#x2019;s house searching for me and scare the bejesus out of her if I left. I&#x2019;ve got enough issues where she&#x2019;s concerned. I don&#x2019;t intend to unleash Cage on her.&#x201d;<br> <br>I slowly made my way over to the only chair in the room and sat down.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re engaged?&#x201d; I asked, staring down at her bare ring finger.<br> <br>With a sad smile she shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not in a million years. Cage has crazy ideas. Just because he says them doesn&#x2019;t make them true.&#x201d;<br> <br>She raised her eyebrows and took another drink of her soda.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you aren&#x2019;t going to marry Cage?&#x201d; I really would love for her to clarify this because I was incredibly confused and more than a little interested in her. She bit down on her bottom lip and I noticed for the first time how full it was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cage was my &#x2018;boy next door&#x2019; growing up. He&#x2019;s my best friend. I love him dearly and he really is all I have. The only person I can count on. We&#x2019;ve never actually been in a relationship before because he knows I won&#x2019;t have sex with him and he needs sex. He&#x2019;s also real wrapped up in the whole idea that a relationship between the two of us before we get married will end badly and he&#x2019;ll lose me. He has this irrational fear of losing me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Did she know the guy had bagged more than three different girls this week and apparently was having a threesome when she&#x2019;d called? She was so much better than Cage.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wipe that look off your face. I don&#x2019;t need your pity. I know what Cage is like. I know you have probably seen the kind of girls he&#x2019;s attracted to, and I look absolutely nothing like them. I don&#x2019;t live in a fantasy world. I&#x2019;m very aware.&#x201d; She tilted her head and smiled at me sweetly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know your name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Marcus Hardy&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Marcus Hardy, I&#x2019;m Willow Montgomery, but everyone calls me Low. It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Likewise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re a friend of Preston&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded. &#x201c;Yes, but don&#x2019;t hold it against me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed for the first time, and the sudden pleasure from such a simple sound startled me. I liked hearing her laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t. Preston isn&#x2019;t all that bad. He likes to use those pretty-boy looks of his to get his way, but I&#x2019;m safe from his attention. Cage would kill him if he decided to bat his baby blues at me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Was it because of Preston&#x2019;s womanizing or the fact that he was a guy that made Cage protective of Willow? Did he really expect her to wait around until he was ready to settle down and marry her?<br> <br>&#x201c;LOW!&#x201d; Cage&#x2019;s voice rang out as the door to the apartment swung open. His head snapped around and his eyes went straight to Willow.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, baby, I was so afraid you&#x2019;d leave. Come here.&#x201d; This was a side of Cage I&#x2019;d never seen. Apparently the sweet little redhead got to him in a way no one else could. He pulled her up into his arms, reached down and grabbed the forgotten suitcase, then led her back to his bedroom, whispering to her the entire way. If she hadn&#x2019;t informed me earlier that she refused to have sex with him, I&#x2019;d have been eaten up with righteous fury at the idea of him touching someone so sweet after having just left the bed of not one but two girls. But instead, I was eaten up with envy because I knew he was going to get to hold her and listen to her musical voice as she spilled out all her problems. He&#x2019;d be the one to fix them, not me. I&#x2019;d just met her. Why the hell did that bother me?</p><h2>Costume Through the Ages: Over 1400 Illustrations (Dover Fashion and Costumes)</h2><p><p>Few books of costume design will prove more useful to artists, students, stage designers, and scholars than this volume.

Rather, the book exhibits how without friendship, our lives are morally not worth living. The book begins with a consideration of why a new model of the moral life is needed. Wadell then examines the ethics of Aristotle, who viewed the moral life as based on a specific understanding of the purpose of being human, with friendship being an important factor in enabling people to acquire virtues necessary for achieving this purpose. Through the thought of Augustine, Aelred of Reivaulx, and Karl Barth, the question is raised whether friendship is at odds with Christian love or whether their relation depends on one's narrative account of friendship. Thomas Aquinas' understanding of charity as friendship with God is examined to clarify this relationship.</p><p>Paul J. Wadell, C.P., is associate professor of religious studies at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin."Wadell has made a convincing case for the necessity of rediscovering Aristotelian and Christian moral principles, particularly those concerning friendship. He demonstrates, with the seasoning of deep personal insight, that seeing friendship with God as the end of the moral life, and friendship with others as indispensable to achieving that goal, is crucial for achieving a full understanding of the moral life." &#x2015;<i>Review of Metaphysics</i></p><h2>Majestie: The King Behind the King James Bible</h2><p><p></p><p></p><p><b>In the Beginning,James. </b></p><p>Orphaned, bullied, lonely, and unloved as a boy, in time theyoung King of Scots overcame his troubled beginnings to ascend the Englishthrone at the height of England&#x2019;s Golden Age.

Teems earned his BA in Psychology at Georgia StateUniversity. David and his wife Benita live in Franklin, Tennessee near theirsons Adam and Shad.For generations, Protestant Christians trusted the King James version of the Bible as the only Bible, dictated to good divines word for word, inerrant in every way, and motivated by a true devotion to God and to the Most Holy Faith. Over time, however, scholars have come to dismiss the idea of the inspiration of the King James version, opening the way for a variety of modern biblical translations. So who was this king who commissioned this version of the Bible? Teems's engrossing and entertaining study of King James I offers a multifaceted view of this 17th-century scholar/scoundrel, a man of counterpoints and contradictions. James is presented as a study in contrasts--a man given to saintly proclamations and vulgar outbursts, but a man who yearned for his own immortality as well as the perpetuity of the monarchy and the patriarchal order, all enshrined in the pages of his Holy Bible. Teems, an active Bible teacher and musician, pulls together the story of this enigmatic king with humor and pathos. This early entry in a full-court press of books marking the 400th anniversary of the translation is a delightful read in every way. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now Reich returns to the world of international thrillers with a no-holds-barred powerhouse of a novel set against the seething backdrop of post&#x2014;World War II Germany....<br><br>July 1945. U.S. attorney Devlin Judge has come to Europe as part of an international tribunal to try Nazi war criminals. But Judge has his own personal agenda: to find Erich Siegfried Seyss, the man responsible for his brother&#x2019;s death.<br><br>An SS officer and former Olympic sprinter, Seyss has just escaped from a POW camp, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. But he won&#x2019;t escape Devlin Judge. <br><br>Between the two men are miles of German countryside ... and the beautiful daughter of one of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s most powerful families &#x2014; a woman loved by them both. <br><br>But as Judge hunts his prey across a devastated nation, he finds himself caught up in a staggering conspiracy. Because Erich Seyss is no rogue SS killer. He is a man running a final race to make one last, unforgettable contribution to the Fatherland. And he is acting on orders from the last person anyone would ever suspect.</p><p>Set against the backdrop of post-World War II Germany, <i>The Runner</i> is the story of Devlin Judge, an ex-New York City detective turned lawyer on the hunt for Nazi SS soldier Erich Seyss, recently escaped from an American POW camp. Seyss, a former Olympic track star known as "The White Lion," is responsible for myriad heinous war crimes, including the murder of a platoon of unarmed American prisoners--one of whom was Judge's own brother. Initially a member of the International Legal Tribunal, set to try former Nazis for crimes against humanity, Judge begs for the opportunity to track Seyss down. With only a week in which to do so, his hunt for the cold-blooded killer leads Judge to a race not only for his own life but for the future of Europe itself. Judge is pursuing a killer, but he is also chasing the ghosts of guilt, having decided not to enlist in the hopes of advancing his legal career: "Erich Seyss was his confession and his penance, his expiation and absolution, all tucked into a black-and-silver uniform with a death's-head embroidered on its collar and his brother's blood on its cuff."<p> <i>The Runner</i> lacks the crackling tension of <i>Numbered Account</i>, Christopher Reich's first novel. Even the moments of crucial conflict, or of bloody disaster, seem wan and pallid. The novel is, paradoxically, handicapped by Reich's respect for historical detail: his interest in presenting the grim realities of postwar existence leads him into extensive descriptions of place and time that fail to merge with the story he spins. These "set pieces" stand awkwardly apart, like dour history professors coaxed into supervising the machinations of rambunctious students. Reich's general fidelity to detail also means that the moments in which he temporarily throws accuracy to the wind are painfully apparent: how on earth would Judge, a well-fed and well-dressed American, manage to look as if he belonged in a German work-group detail? And when would any three-star general ever tolerate the gum-cracking insouciance of Judge's driver Darren Honey, a sergeant with no regard for military hierarchy? Oddly enough, the authorial liberties Reich takes with General George Patton, saddling him with a megalomaniac's hatred of the Russians and a schemer's plot to redraw the boundaries of postwar Europe, are largely successful and add a welcome note of barely contained evil.</p><p> <i>The Runner</i> works best as a moving meditation on personal and social disjunction: Judge, Seyss, Patton, and the rest are desperately engaged in deciphering the proper place for prewar rules in the postwar chaos--and in confronting the uneasy suspicion that perhaps, after all, there is no place for them or for their beliefs. Judge must move past his easy assumption that the Allied victory was not "just a symbol of superior might but of superior morality": "Overnight, he'd become the hunted, not the hunter.... At some point during the last twenty-four hours, he'd crossed over an interior median into unknown waters. He'd abandoned the rigid structure of his previous life, renounced his worship of authority, and forsworn his devotion to rules and regulation. He'd tossed Hoyle to the wind, and he didn't care." <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>&#x201c;A wonderful novel of conspiracy, treachery and political intrigue ...

Desperate to avoid public embarrassment -- and to avoid paying a ransom -- the Italian prime minister leans hard on Flavia to get it back quickly and quietly. <br> Across town, her husband, art historian Jonathan Argyll, begins an investigation of his own, tracing the past of a small Renaissance painting -- an Immaculate Conception -- owned by Flavia's mentor, retired general Taddeo Bottando. Soon both husband and wife uncover astonishing and chilling secrets, and Flavia's investigation takes a sudden turn from the search for an art thief to the hunt for a murderer.</p><p><b>Iain Pears</b> is the author of the New York Times bestseller <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i> and <i>The Portrait.</i> He lives in Oxford, England.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>One morning, a fine May morning in Rome, when the sun was beaming through the clouds of carbon monoxide and dust and giving a soft, fresh feel to the day, Flavia di Stefano sat immobile in a vast traffic jam that began in the Piazza del Popolo and ended somewhere near the Piazza Venezia. Many people, at least those with a different personality from her own, would have been unperturbed by this common occurrence, and would instead have contemplated their surroundings with something approaching patient smugness. Not many, after all, can call on a Mercedes, complete with chauffeur and obligatory tinted windows, to ferry them around town at the taxpayers' expense. Fewer still at such a young age are the head (if only the <i>acting</i> head) of one of the more reputable departments in the Italian police force, complete with its own budget, personnel, and expense accounts. <br><br>And virtually none of the small number of departmental potentates use their splendid forms of transport to go to unspecified meetings, called late the previous evening, at the Palazzo Chigi, the official residence of the Italian prime minister.<br><br>That, of course, was the problem, and the reason behind Flavia's insensitivity to the early morning sunshine, and her disdain for all living things. For a start, her collar itched monstrously, and was a permanent, nagging reminder of her own inexperience and desire to create the right impression. Instead of sitting quietly that morning eating toast and drinking coffee, she had run around showering, choosing clothes, and worst of all, applying copious amounts of makeup. Then having a fit of defiance and taking it all off again, then weakening with nerves and putting it all back on. Worse still, she stood peering out of the window into the little piazza below, anxiously waiting for the car to arrive, checking and rechecking the contents of her handbag. She had nightmare visions of grabbing her coat and running through the streets of Rome to get there. Breaking a heel on a cobblestone. Arriving out of breath, her hair in a mess. Creating entirely the wrong impression. Career destroyed, over in a moment, just because some damn fool driver didn't turn up. And what was more, she felt ill; stomach in a turmoil, the rest of her queasy. Bug. Flu, probably. Nervousness. Something like that. It was going to be one of those days. She knew it.<br><br>"Flavia. Do stop jiggling about like that. You're making me nervous." Jonathan Argyll, her husband of four weeks' standing, and boyfriend-cum-flatmate of near ten years, sat at the kitchen table trying to read the newspaper. "It's only the prime minister, you know."<br><br>Flavia turned around to scowl at him.<br><br>"I'm not being facetious," he went on calmly as he reached for the marmalade before she could tell him what she thought of his sense of whimsy. "You know as well as I do that bad news is always handed out by underlings. Besides, you haven't done anything wrong recently, have you? Not misplaced a Raphael, dropped a Michelangelo, shot a senator, or anything?"<br><br>Another scowl. <br><br>"There you are, then. Nothing to worry about," he continued, getting up to give her a quick pat to indicate that he sympathized. "Even less now that your car has arrived."<br><br>He pointed downward, waved cheerfully at the driver, whom he vaguely recognized, and even more cheerfully at Flavia, as she rushed for her bag and coat.<br><br>"Calm. Remember?" he said as she opened the door. <br><br>"I remember."<br><br>Calm, she repeated to herself thirty minutes later as she looked at her watch one more time. Stuck in a traffic jam, half a mile to go, five minutes late. At least it cut the unaccustomed car sickness. Calm, she thought.<br><br>It was Bottando's fault, really, she reflected. Her erstwhile boss, now gone on to greater things, was one of those who liked formulating universal laws about life, which he delivered as aphorisms that came back to haunt you at inappropriate moments. <br><br>"Politicians," he said once over a glass of brandy following a long lunch. "Politicians can ruin your day. Ministers, on the other hand, can ruin your week."<br><br>"And prime ministers?" Flavia had asked.<br><br>"Prime ministers? Oh, they can ruin your life."<br><br>His little bon mot, for some reason, didn't seem quite so urbane at the moment. She considered leaning forward to see if the driver could go any faster, but abandoned the idea. Another one of Bottando's rules. Never let anyone see you are nervous -- especially not drivers, who are notoriously the biggest gossips on the planet. So, like a condemned man who finally realizes his fate is inevitable, she gave a big sigh, leaned back, and gave up fretting. Immediately, the lights changed, the cars began moving, and the palazzo came into sight. She was waved through the vast wooden gates into the courtyard with virtually no delay, and within minutes was being ushered into an anteroom to an anteroom to the office where Antonio Sabauda, prime minister now for a whole nine months, held his audiences. Fourteen minutes late. <br><br>Her guardian angel was on duty, working hard on her behalf. Sabauda was later still, and over the next forty minutes she allowed herself to work up a fine head of steam about the lack of consideration shown by unpunctual people. In fact, by the time the door was finally opened and she was shown in, the nervousness was gone, the deference dissipated, the stomach quiescent, and her character quite restored to its normal state. <br><br>So she marched into the surprisingly dingy office thinking only how stupid she had been to put on quite so much lipstick and wishing she hadn't bothered, shook hands with the prime minister in a uninterested fashion, and sat down on a chair before she was asked. What did she care? She hadn't voted for him.<br><br>He scored early points by referring neither to her age, nor to the fact that she was a woman, and pushed his rating even higher by not indulging in any small talk. Then he spoiled it all by expressing surprise that Bottando himself had not come. Flavia reminded him that she, not General Bottando, was now running the art theft squad on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>"But he is still the head of it, is he not?"<br><br>"Nominally. But he takes no active role in our operations anymore. He is running this European venture, and that uses up all his time."<br><br>"And more of his patience," the prime minister added for her with a faint smile. "I see. And I am sure we are in safe hands with you, signora. I do hope so anyway. I'm afraid there is something of a crisis on hand. I would tell you about it myself, but I know few of the details. Dottore Macchioli knows those, and he has just arrived. This, I'm afraid, is why you have been kept waiting for so long."<br><br>Of course, Flavia thought. All is now clear. Alessandro Macchioli was one of those endearingly lovable characters who sows disaster everywhere he goes. Never on time for anything, however much he tried, always colliding with all manner of inanimate objects that leapt out at him as he passed, he was the very model of the unworldly scholar. And as a scholar he was very fine indeed, so Jonathan told her, as he knew more about this sort of thing than she did. But as the director of the National Museum, he was, in Bottando's opinion, one of the wonders of the world. His elevation had come on the rebound; his predecessor had been go-getting, dynamic, determined to drag the musty museum into modernity, and was shortly to be let out of jail. The embarrassment had been considerable, and Macchioli -- who could not only resist temptation but probably wouldn't even notice he was being tempted -- had seemed the obvious successor, in the circumstances. A safe pair of hands; back to the traditional values of connoisseurship, erudition, and old-time curating. A universally beloved figure, in fact, but quite incapable of defending his patch against the incursions of bureaucrats who wished to cut his funds, to ooze up to potential benefactors, or to manage his disorganized museum.<br><br>And deeply unhappy, Flavia judged from the nervous way he came in, thrusting his bicycle clips into the bulging pocket of his shabby suit. It was all most intriguing.<br><br>Macchioli sat down, fiddled with his hands, and looked uncomfortable as the introductions were made.<br><br>"Perhaps we might begin?" the prime minister prompted. <br><br>"Ah, yes," Macchioli said absently.<br><br>"You have a problem that you wish to tell the signora about?"<br><br>Persuading himself to divulge it was evidently a titanic struggle, almost as though he knew that, once he had spoken, all sorts of unpleasant consequences might begin to swirl around him. He rocked to and fro, hunched his shoulders, rubbed his nose, and then, in a sudden burst of decision, spoke: "I've lost a picture. The museum has. It was stolen."<br><br>Flavia was puzzled. She could see why he was upset. Awkward business, losing pictures. That was not the problem, however. They went missing all the time; so often, in fact, that the routine for what to do was well established. You phoned the police. They went around, did their stuff and then you forgot all about it, on the reasonable grounds that the picture was unlikely ever to be seen again. All perfectly normal. It was hearing about it in the prime minister's office that was not entirely orthodox.<br><br>"I see," she said helpfully, but poor old Macchioli did not take it as a prompt to continue; instead he lapsed into another agonized silence.<br><br>"For the last five years, you see, we have been planning an exhibition." He restarted, evidently deciding that a sidelong approach might be best. "To celebrate Italy's presidency of the European Community, which begins in fifteen days' time. Drawing on all aspects of European art, but I am afraid that some people" -- and here he gave a surreptitious glance in the direction of the desk at which the prime minister was sitting -- "some people have sought to turn it into a nationalistic demonstration."<br><br>"Just a small reminder of our contribution in matters of culture," the prime minister purred.<br><br>"This has made borrowing the works a little more difficult than it might have been," Macchioli continued. "Not that it is relevant to the disaster that has befallen us..."<br><br>The prime minister, showing more patience than his reputation would have suggested possible, sighed in the background. It was enough to bring Macchioli's errant mind back to the immediate issue.<br><br>"We did, however, finally arrange to borrow nearly all the paintings we wanted. Most from Italian institutions, naturally, but a good proportion from foreign museums and owners. Many of the pictures have never been seen in this country before."<br><br>"But I know about all this," said Flavia with more impatience than the prime minister was showing. "We've been involved in the planning for years. Members of my department escorted the first few paintings from the airport to the museum last week."<br><br>"Yes. And a very fine job you did, too. No mistake about that. Very fine. Unfortunately..."<br><br>"The one you've had stolen. It was one of those?"<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>"When?"<br><br>"Yesterday. At lunchtime."<br><br>"Lunchtime? Then why are you only telling me about it now?"<br><br>"It was very awkward, you see. I wasn't at all sure what to do about it..."<br><br>"Perhaps I might fill the signora in?" The prime minister interrupted, glancing at his watch and realizing that, unless something was done soon, this meeting might last for the rest of the day and Macchioli still wouldn't have explained anything. "Please correct me if I get the details wrong. I understand the picture was stolen at around half past one yesterday. A hooded man reversed a truck into the storage area, held up the people working there, forced them to load the painting, complete with its frame, into the back of the truck, and drove off. Is that correct?"<br><br>Macchioli nodded.<br><br>Flavia, fidgeting around in her seat, opened her mouth to make the obvious protests about wasted time, trails going cold, and so on.<br><br>"Your department, signora, was not called because the thief left behind a message saying that the police should not be contacted."<br><br>"A ransom demand, is that it?"<br><br>A shrug. "Not exactly. Just that we'd be hearing more in due course. I suppose that means money."<br><br>"Maybe so. What, exactly, is the picture?"<br><br>"It's a Claude Lorrain. <i>Landscape with Cephalus and Procris,"</i> Macchioli said reluctantly.<br><br>Flavia paused. "Oh, not <i>that</i> one, surely? Not the one where the government intervened officially to guarantee it?"<br><br>He nodded. You could see why he was upset, she thought. Not that it was such a great picture, although she always found Claude quite toothsome. Not a Raphael, or anything like that. But it had such a dodgy past. Its reputation as one of the most stolen pictures in the world ensured it a status beyond its simple quality. Argyll, no doubt, would remember the details better than she could, but she could recall the highlights. Painted in the 1630s for an Italian cardinal. Pinched by the duke of Modena when he found it in a wagon after a battle. Pinched again by a French general a few years later. Looted and sold during the French Revolution, pinched again by Napoleon when he came across it in Holland. Stolen by thieves in the 1930s, by the Germans in the 1940s, and by two more thieves in the 1950s and 1960s. Whereupon the exasperated owner sold it to the Louvre, in the hope that they would manage to hang on to it. Which they had. Until, it seemed, it had arrived in Italy. <br><br>"Oh, dear," she said. <br><br>"You see our problem," the prime minister continued. "It is exceptionally unpleasant for me, as I gave a personal guarantee about its safety. Quite apart from that, this exhibition is to be one of the cultural high points of our presidency. It would be very bad indeed if it was wrecked, and it would be wrecked if this news gets out. It is quite possible that other lenders would pull out, and even if they didn't our reputation would be damaged badly. You can imagine what would be said. We would look quite ridiculous."<br><br>Flavia nodded. "So? When you get the ransom demand you pay up."<br><br>"The only problem is that it is illegal. If we arrest people for paying ransoms to rescue their wives and children, we can hardly pay up for a mere painting."<br><br>A silence fell on the room, and it seemed as though Flavia was expected to say something useful.<br><br>"You mean you want me to find the painting?"<br><br>"I would ordinarily be deeply grateful, but in this case, no. How many people would you use for such an inquiry?"<br><br>Flavia thought for a moment. "Everyone we had, if you wanted a quick result. Not that I can guarantee one."<br><br>"And could you at least guarantee to keep it out of the press?"<br><br>"For about six hours, yes."<br><br>"Precisely. Secrecy in this matter is absolutely vital. Even if you were successful and recovered the painting swiftly, the damage would still be done."<br><br>"In which case, I confess to being defeated. You won't pay a ransom and won't look for the painting. What, exactly, do you want done?"<br><br><i>"We</i> cannot pay a ransom. The <i>government</i> cannot authorize such a thing. <i>Taxpayers'</i> money cannot be used. Nor can any government employee be involved in its payment. Do I make myself clear?"<br><br>He did. But Flavia had not spent years watching Bottando take avoiding action without learning a thing or two.<br><br>"I'm afraid I'm not with you at all. Sorry," she said blandly.<br><br>"You will use your best abilities to recover this painting without any publicity. But I must make it absolutely clear that I cannot and will not condone the payment of a ransom from <i>public</i> fu...</p><h2>Hidalgo and Other Stories</h2><p>It started as a search for heroes. It became a hunt for the most elusive equestrian charlatan of all time. If Frank Hopkins is to be believed, he led one of the most exciting, challenging and colorful (albeit unrecorded) lives in the late nineteenth century. No one rode more miles, eluded more danger, or befriended more famous people than he did. During the 1930s and 40s the self-proclaimed legend told a na�ve American public that he had won nearly five hundred endurance races, including an imaginary race across Arabia on a mythical mustang named &#34;Hidalgo.&#34; Hopkins&#39; remarkable career supposedly began when he became a dispatch rider for the US government on his twelfth birthday in 1877. According to his mythology, this Renaissance Man of the Old West went on to work as a buffalo hunter, Indian fighter, African explorer, endurance racer, trick rider, bounty hunter, Rough Rider, big game guide, secret agent, Pinkerton detective and star of the Wild West show. Experts beg to differ. This book contains an unprecedented study, undertaken by more than seventy experts in five countries, ranging from the Curator of the Buffalo Bill Museum to the former Sultan of Yemen. These academics investigated the historical improbability of Hopkins&#39; claims and weighed him on his merit, not his myth. The resulting exhaustive study revealed that Hopkins had maintained a spirited disregard for the truth, plagiarized material from famous authors, slandered genuine American heroes and perpetrated a massive fraud for nearly one hundred years. Far from being the star of Buffalo Bill Cody&#39;s Wild West show for 32 years, for example, the counterfeit cowboy was discovered working as a subway tunnel digger in Philadelphia and a horse-handler for Ringling Brothers Circus. It is his endurance racing pretensions, however, that have brought Hopkins his greatest notoriety and made him the hero of a Hollywood movie. Yet there is not even a documented photograph of Frank Hopkins in the saddle! Here then are all the known writings of Frank T. Hopkins, published in their entirety for the first time in history.</p><p></p><h2>The Witch&#39;s Dream: A Healer&#39;s Way of Knowledge (Compass)</h2><p>This is the extraordinary account of Donner-Grau&#39;s experiences with do�a Mercedes, an aged healer in a remote Venezuelan town known for its spiritualists, sorcerers, and mediums.</p><p><b>Florinda Donner-Grau</b>&nbsp;is an American anthropologist and writer, whose books include&nbsp;<i>The Witch&#x2019;s Dream: A Healer&#x2019;s Way of Knowledge</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Being-in-Dreaming: An Initiation into the Sorcerers&#x2019; World</i>.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Carlos Castaneda</b> was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, gathering information on various medicinal herbs used by the Indians in Sonora, Mexico, when he met the old Yaqui Indian Don Juan.

Every element of the chapel bears the artist's touch, from the vivid Mediterranean hues of the stained-glass windows to the starkly powerful murals; even the vestments and altar were designed by Matisse.

Fourteen thousand feet below on the blue Pacific surface were the distinctive flat lines of two Japanese aircraft carriers. Birney had a determined calm about him as he briefly eyed the thin white wakes streaming behind the gleaming yellow-hued hardwood flight decks far below his dive-bomber.</p><p><i>I couldn&#x2019;t ask for a better setup,</i> he thought. <i>A dive-bomber pilot&#x2019;s dream.</i></p><p>He had not felt as happy the night before as he sat in the carrier <i>Enterprise</i>&#x2019;s wardroom.

Birney puffed on his cigarette and gulped black coffee as the commander barked, &#x201c;The Japs are determined to drive us out of the south Pacific. If they get through to Guadalcanal with their carriers tomorrow, the Japs will take it. If Guadalcanal falls, our lifeline to Australia will be menaced.&#x201d;</p><p>Crommelin emphasized that his aviators were to concentrate on knocking out the enemy&#x2019;s carriers. The comment about letting a good pilot take your place if necessary had particular harshness for Birney Strong that was not felt by the more junior aviators. Just two months before, he had sighted and reported a Japanese carrier force off the Solomon Islands. Instead of attacking, he had led his wingman home, a decision he had regretted for weeks. Crommelin had of course chastised Strong for his decision not to attack. Since that day, most of Strong&#x2019;s squadron had been granted leave back to the States, but not Birney. He had been ordered right back out to the Pacific war zone to continue the fight for Guadalcanal. Now the third senior pilot of a new scout-bombing carrier squadron, he had one goal: to prove his valor to Commander Crommelin by blasting the next Japanese carrier he faced.</p><p>In his own mind, however, Birney had nothing to prove to himself. He had been involved in almost every major Pacific offensive since the start of World War II ten months ago. The handsome, blond-haired, blue-eyed pilot had a swagger of confidence that he had earned. In February, he was one of the first pilots to attack Japanese shipping in the Gilbert Islands. In March, he had attacked Japanese shipping in the New Guinea harbors of Lae and Salamaua. In early May, he made three more attacks against Japanese ships in Tulagi Harbor in the Solomons. Strong dive-bombed the Japanese carrier<i> Shoho</i> three days later during the Coral Sea carrier battle and then used his SBD Dauntless dive-bomber like a fighter to battle Japanese Zero fighters attacking his own task force.</p><p>Lieutenant Strong was a top-notch pilot who had racked up eight hundred flight hours since graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1937. His awards already included a Navy Cross, an honor second only to a Medal of Honor. He was good at what he did, and was not afraid to let others know of his confidence. He knew that some considered him to be arrogant. But the cocky scout pilot from Washington, DC, needed more than his impressive record to restore the goodwill of his air officer. Strong&#x2019;s failure to attack the Japanese carrier in August off the Eastern Solomons was a personal mission to correct.</p><p>Now, on the morning of October 26, 1942, was his fresh chance. High above the Pacific, Birney Strong was leading one of the eight teams of SBDs on the early scout-strike mission. He was fired up and ready to make his bomb count. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll find the yellowbellies are in your sector,&#x201d; Birney told his squadron skipper before takeoff. &#x201c;When you find them, call out loud.&#x201d;</p><p>His skipper had indeed located the enemy and Strong moved in quickly with his wingman, Ensign Chuck Irvine. They soon spotted the Japanese carriers <i>Shokaku</i> and <i>Zuiho </i>emerging from under a layer of clouds far below their dive-bombers. &#x201c;Uncle John&#x201d; Crommelin&#x2019;s speech the previous evening left little doubt in Birney&#x2019;s mind. His mission was to turn back the Japanese carriers that threatened thousands of U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal and the course of America&#x2019;s first Pacific offensive. Uncle John had made it clear that the aviators should &#x201c;knock the sons of bitches off the face of the earth.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lieutenant Birney Strong of VS-5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Birney glanced over to Irvine&#x2019;s nearby SBD. He planned to dive on the nearest flattop, so he patted the top of his leather flight helmet. <i>I&#x2019;ve got it</i>, Birney signaled to Ensign Irvine. <i>Follow me.</i></p><p>Birney activated his dive flaps; Irvine instinctively slid his Dauntless away to allow the proper spacing interval. The pair nosed over two and three-quarter miles above their prey to begin the thirty-second plunge to the release point.</p><p>The teakwood deck of <i>Zuiho</i> grew closer by the second. The big red circle painted forward on the Japanese aircraft carrier&#x2019;s flight deck looked like the bull&#x2019;s-eye on a dartboard. Birney Strong had no intention of drawing the scorn of Commander Crommelin again. He would nail this bastard with his bomb or die trying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ONE</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s All Exciting as Hell&#x201d;</p><p>D<i>amn my luck.</i></p><p>Warm salt spray hit Robert John Henry Weinzapfel&#x2019;s face as he watched another dive-bomber hurtle forward down the teak-covered flight deck. It was not uncommon for off-duty sailors to gather topside in &#x201c;Vulture&#x2019;s Row&#x201d; on the island superstructure to watch aircraft departing from and landing on their massive carrier. The seaborne airfield was only 90 feet wide but stretched 880 feet, nearly three football fields long. One by one, the blue-gray-colored warplanes roared skyward.</p><p>The smell of tropical flora was in the air and the Hawaiian Islands were breaking the horizon in the distance. The seas were rough. &#x201c;The ship was rolling something awful, and a few of the boys furnished us with some thrills in taking off,&#x201d; Weinzapfel wrote that night.1</p><p>He watched as some of his squadron&#x2019;s junior pilots&#x2014;Ensigns Tony Quigley, Marvin Haschke, Richard Neely, Jack Leppla, and Roy Hale&#x2014;launched. Even Harry Wood, the newest pilot who had joined a month after Robert, was now en route to liberty on Oahu.</p><p>The date was October 18, 1941, and Ensign Weinzapfel looked on with envy as the planes soared away. After eighteen months in flight training, he was now grounded. He massaged the injured ear that had taken him off active flight duty and cursed his own poor luck.</p><p>His fellow pilots had lifted off from the deck of the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s aircraft carrier <i>Lexington</i> (CV-2). She and her sister <i>Saratoga</i> (CV-3) were the largest warships afloat, each nearly nine hundred feet in length and in service since 1927. Named for American Revolution battles, <i>Lexington</i> and <i>Saratoga</i> had been laid down on the hulls of battle cruisers, and each behemoth would displace fifty thousand tons when fully loaded. Many of their sailors had affectionately nicknamed the sibling flattops &#x201c;Lady Lex&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sister Sara.&#x201d; Each could operate ninety aircraft and sported only two aircraft elevators, as opposed to three on the newer carriers being built. By 1941, however, both carriers were effectively restricted to a single elevator, as neither used the smaller elevators at all during daylight operations.</p><p>As of late 1941, each Navy fleet carrier operated two dive-bomber squadrons. The carriers <i>Ranger</i> (CV-4) and <i>Wasp</i> (CV-7) were on duty in the Atlantic, handling neutrality patrols against Nazi U-boats. The Navy&#x2019;s newest carrier, <i>Hornet</i> (CV-8), was nearing completion and would soon begin operating its own air group in early 1942. For the moment, most of the new pilots that made it to fleet duty were assigned to <i>Lexington</i>, <i>Saratoga</i>, <i>Yorktown </i>(CV-5), or <i>Enterprise </i>(CV-6).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ensign Robert John Henry Weinzapfel of <i>Lexington</i>&#x2019;s VS-2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ensign Weinzapfel was one of twenty-one pilot officers assigned to <i>Lexington</i>&#x2019;s Scouting Squadron Two (VS-2). The dark-haired, boyish-faced twenty-four-year-old from north Texas was a recent graduate of the Navy&#x2019;s flight-training program. Born in the small town of Scotland, he was the oldest of eight children. As a youth, Robert and his devout Catholic family had moved a short distance from Windthorst, Texas, east to the rural town of Muenster when his father, Joseph, and business partner, John Meurer, started the Muenster State Bank there in 1923.</p><p>In school, Robert had excelled in both athletics and academics, and he graduated at the top of his class. Following college at St. Mary&#x2019;s in San Antonio, he had gone to an Army Air Force recruiter to pursue his interest in aviation. He expressed some doubts, however, about his own ability to shoot down another plane in combat&#x2014;thus taking someone else&#x2019;s life&#x2014;and the Army recruiter turned him down. Robert remained unfazed, conferred next with a Navy recruiter, and was accepted right away.</p><p>Ensign Weinzapfel&#x2019;s elimination flight training began in April 1940 in naval trainers, first in San Antonio and soon migrating to Opa-Locka, Florida, by July. His first solo flight came on August 1, 1940, in an N3N-3 biplane naval trainer&#x2014;nicknamed the &#x201c;Yellow Peril&#x201d; by pilots both for its bright color and for the high number of aviation cadets who washed out of flight training. In September, Robert had the thrill of flying again back in Texas, including his hometown of Muenster, where he gave short flights to his father and to siblings Joe, Henry, Thomas, and Juanita.</p><p>During early 1941, Weinzapfel flew the Stearman N2S biplane trainer at Pensacola Naval Air Station (NAS). He progressed in April to the next training level at NAS Miami, and in May was assigned to Scouting Squadron Three under Lieutenant Commander Robert C. Sutliff on board the carrier <i>Saratoga</i>. Weinzapfel&#x2019;s training progressed on instrument flying, navigation, section tactics, and practice carrier landings. During June and July, he often swapped flying and riding rear seat with fellow trainees Horace Proulx, Bob Elder, Charlie Lane, Wesley Osmus, Leonard Thornhill, Corwin Morgan, and Jack Leppla as they became carrier-qualified.</p><p>John Arthur &#x201c;Jack&#x201d; Leppla, a Purdue University graduate from Lima, Ohio, became Weinzapfel&#x2019;s best friend and roommate throughout flight training. Jack was of Mediterranean ancestry, with dark hair, bushy eyebrows, and a dark complexion. Aviation was in the Leppla blood. Jack&#x2019;s brother Paul was an Army Air Force mechanic and his other brother, George, was flying Pan American Clipper planes in the Pacific Zone. Jack possessed an outgoing personality and competitive nature. During flight training at Pensacola, he fell back on his high school football abilities by playing on the NAS team. He narrowly escaped death in February 1941 when he and fellow trainee Ensign Robert F. Fenley&#x2019;s naval trainers collided at fifteen hundred feet above Bayou Grande near Pensacola. Both ensigns jumped from their crippled planes in parachutes but Fenley drowned after splashing down.2</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Weinzapfel and Leppla were inseparable during the fall of 1941. They had roomed together through flight training in both Pensacola and in Miami. When <i>Saratoga</i> moved to San Diego, they became roommates again there. Both pilots were reassigned from VS-3 and moved ashore to the North Island NAS at San Diego. That summer, Mrs. Leppla and Robert Weinzapfel&#x2019;s parents paid their sons a visit. The young pilots took great pride in showing their parents around the air station and enjoyed a meal together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dauntless pilot Jack Leppla of <i>Lexington</i>&#x2019;s Scouting Two, wearing his golden wings naval aviator insignia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leppla and Weinzapfel were reassigned from Scouting Three into VS-2 at North Island on August 13, 1941. The organization of their new <i>Lexington</i> Air Group was similar to what they had become accustomed to on Sister Sara. There was a fighter squadron, VF-2, and a torpedo squadron, VT-2, along with two dive-bomber squadrons flying the Douglas SBD. All of the <i>Lexington</i> airmen fell under the charge of Lieutenant Commander William Bowen Ault of Enterprise, Oregon. To young men like Weinzapfel and Leppla, Bill Ault was a fatherly figure at age forty-three. A 1922 Naval Academy graduate, Ault had flown in the aviation unit of the cruiser <i>Cincinnati</i> and with Patrol Squadron (VP) 10-S on the old aircraft tender <i>Wright </i>(AV-1). He had also served on the carriers <i>Lexington</i>, <i>Enterprise</i>, and <i>Yorktown</i>, before returning to <i>Lexington</i> in July 1941 to become her senior aviator. As the commander of the <i>Lexington</i> Air Group, Bill Ault was known by the moniker &#x201c;CLAG&#x201d; to his pilots.</p><p>Commander Ault was tall and lean, with an easygoing personality. He was not one to direct from the tarmac, however. Ault jumped in his cockpit and participated alongside his newer pilots in simulated attacks as his air group became more seasoned at NAS North Island. The squadrons began receiving the new Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bomber during this training period. Each of the <i>Lexington</i> squadrons, Bombing Two and Scouting Two, was designed to operate eighteen SBDs, with a few spare pilots each to fill in for anyone sick or injured.</p><p>Weinzapfel practiced flying instrument training flights with fellow rookies Roy Hale and Tony Quigley, the young VS-2 pilots alternating between rear seat and pilot&#x2019;s cockpits to help each other. Scouting Two was under Lieutenant Commander Robert Ellington Dixon, a 1927 academy graduate from the little Georgia town of Richland, south of Atlanta. Like Bill Ault, thirty-five-year-old Bob Dixon was quiet but confident in his own abilities. Dixon&#x2019;s squadron was equally split between regular Naval Academy graduates and newly commissioned ensigns fresh from flight school. Six other officers had graduated from Annapolis: Edward Allen, Hoyt Mann, John &#x201c;Pappy&#x201d; Hunter, Thomas &#x201c;Bobby&#x201d; Edwards, Roy Hale, and Evan Peter &#x201c;Pete&#x201d; Aurand.</p><p>Some of the academy boys had no more flight time than VS-2&#x2019;s younger ensigns. Lieutenant (j.g.) Pete Aurand had earned his golden wings only in February 1941, but it would be his second tour of duty on the carrier <i>Lexington</i>. He had served as a junior gunnery officer on the carrier during his mandatory two years of surface duty after graduating from the academy.</p><p>Born in New York City, Pete was the son of Major General Henry S. Aurand, head of the Army&#x2019;s Sixth Service Command. An uncle and a cousin had joined the Navy, and Pete also found a calling for sea duty, although his younger brother followed in their father&#x2019;s footsteps by graduating from West Point. Pete racked up various behavior demerits while at Annapolis but graduated in 1938 and eventually became part of Bob Dixon&#x2019;s Scouting Two. &#x201c;There was a distinction prewar between scouting squadrons and bomber squadrons, even though they had the same airplane,&#x201d; he said later. &#x201c;In the scouting squadron, you did air-to-air gunnery, dive-bombing, scouting, and so forth. The dive-bomber guys concentrated on bombing. I decided that the scouting squadron did everything: air-to-air gunne...</p></p><h2>Essential Ayurveda: What It Is and What It Can Do for You</h2><p>Ayurveda is perhaps one of the most popular "holistic" health practices in the United States. Based on 5,000 years of practice and observation and popularized in part in the works of Deepak Chopra, "ayurveda" translates into "the science of life" and takes into account the spiritual, mental, and physcial aspects of health. After a brief definition of ayurveda and the basic elements, ESSENTIAL AYURVEDA outlines the practical steps any person can take to become healthier.<br><br>According to the author, "ayurveda" is a verb. The book is set up with simple suggestions to get readers started on the path to good health. As Shubhra writes, "attack your goal of great health in bite-sized chunks, and you&#x2019;ll get there without ever overstepping your comfort zone. In concrete terms, to "do" Ayurveda is to make healthy choices in daily life. These choices can be as simple as choosing fresh fruit over a donut, choosing a health magazine over a horror novel, choosing to sleep instead of watching late night television."<br><br></p><p>"... surpassed my expectations...Krishan explores and explains each principle in comprehensible terms." -- <i>Healing Lifestyles &amp; Spas, March/April 2003</i><br><br>[It's] jargon-free, practical approach makes it a pleasure to read...compelling enough that you just might want to try it." -- <i>Alternative Medicine March 2003</i></p><h2>Em and the Big Hoom: A Novel</h2><p><b>The devastatingly original debut novel from a winner of the 2016 Windham-Campbell Prize for Fiction.<br><br>&#x201c;Profoundly moving . . .

His ears are the sweetest thing about him. They look like bits of bacon curled up from too much frying.&#x2019;</p><p>I had never thought of my father&#x2019;s ears. But later that evening, as he stood in the kitchen and cooked for me and my sister, scraping at a fry-up of potatoes, I saw that his ears were indeed unusual. When was the first time that she noticed his ears? Was it part of her falling in love with him, or did it happen in the hypersensitive moments that follow? And when she called him by that name the first time, did he respond immediately? He probably did, without asking why. They could be like that together.</p><p>It intrigues me, love. Especially theirs, which seems to have been full of codes and rituals, almost all of them devised by her. She also called him Mambo, and Augie March, but almost never by his given name, Augustine.</p><p>He called her Imelda, which was her name, and, sometimes, Beloved.</p><p>� � �</p><p>She had another name for him: Limb of Satan. LOS. I asked her about that late one night, when the two of us were smoking together on the balcony of our small flat in a city of small flats. Behind us the one-bedroom-hall-kitchen, all 450 square feet of it, was quiet. In front of us, the side of a tenement rose like a cliff-face. Two trees were framed in between the buildings and in the foliage of one, a streetlight flickered erratically. She started laughing, a harsh scrape of sound that might belong in a brothel.</p><p>&#x2018;Because he was always tempting me to sin,&#x2019; she said.</p><p>&#x2018;Who was?&#x2019; Susan, my sister, was awake. She fitted herself into the balcony, waving a hand at the cloud of smoke we were producing.</p><p>&#x2018;Your father.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s not a sin if you&#x2019;re married, is it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s always a sin according to the Wholly Roaming Cat Licks.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That can&#x2019;t be true.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can it not? I think you&#x2019;re only supposed to do it if you want babies. I wanted four but Hizzonner said, &#x201c;Then you pay for the other two.&#x201d; That, as they say, was that. And I had to give the twenty-six others away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What!&#x2019; Susan and I looked at each other. Were there hordes of siblings we knew nothing about?</p><p>&#x2018;I gave them straight out of my womb,&#x2019; she explained. &#x2018;I could always tell when it had happened. I&#x2019;d hear a click and I would know I was pregnant again, and I&#x2019;d pray to Our Lady to take the poor wee thing and give it to someone else who wanted a child. Maybe one of those women who buy wax babies to offer the said Lady at Mahim.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So you&#x2019;d have . . .&#x2019; I ventured.</p><p>&#x2018;Abortions? No, what do you take me for? I&#x2019;d just climb down five stairs and jump six.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Jump down the stairs?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Six steps and land with a thump, six times, to shake those little mites from their moorings.&#x2019;</p><p>She turned to Susan.</p><p>&#x2018;But if you get knocked up, you come and tell me and I&#x2019;ll come with you to the doctor. We&#x2019;ll get you D&#x2019;d and C&#x2019;d before you can say Dick with a Thing and a Tongue.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What is deed and seed?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Dilation and curettage. I don&#x2019;t know what exactly it is but it sounds like they open you up and put a young priest in there. Anyway, only doctors do it. So when you&#x2019;re knocked up, you&#x2019;ll get a proper doctor to fiddle with your middle, you hear? No back-street abortions for you.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What about adoption?&#x2019; Susan asked.</p><p>&#x2018;What about it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mother Teresa came to college and &#x2013;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She came to your college?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You didn&#x2019;t tell me.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No. No one tells me anything. What did she say?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She said that if we got pregnant we should carry the child to term and give it to her.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She said that? Gosh.&#x2019;</p><p>She frowned and was silent for a moment, considering this.</p><p>&#x2018;I suppose it comes from not having lived in the world for hundreds of years. She&#x2019;s lived in a convent, it&#x2019;s not her fault. But still. Suppose I got pregnant today. Suppose I got nice and big and everyone asked, &#x201c;When is it due?&#x201d; and &#x201c;My, you&#x2019;re carrying in the front, it must be a boy,&#x201d; and &#x201c;What do you want? Pink or blue?&#x201d; &#x2013; and after all that, there&#x2019;s no baby at my breast. What do you think they&#x2019;d think? What would I say? &#x201c;Oh, I carried the baby to term and then I sent him off to Mother T because I couldn&#x2019;t afford him and I didn&#x2019;t want to have an abortion . . . ?&#x201d;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Maybe you&#x2019;re supposed to hide,&#x2019; I said.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh yes, go away for a vacation for six or seven months. Where?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Goa?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Goa!&#x2019; she said theatrically. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s worse than having it in Bombay. You might as well take an advert out in O Heraldo &#x2013; &#x201c;Fallen woman available for gawking and comments behind hankies. Holy Family parish church, Sunday Mass.

We confess to men who&#x2019;ve never had to worry about a family. Naturally, it&#x2019;s a huge sin to them, this abortion business. What do they know? They probably think it&#x2019;s fun and games. Let them try it. I remember poor Gertie. Once, she was sure that it had happened &#x2013;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;An abortion?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, stupid, a pregnancy &#x2013; she was late, and she was never late, so she knew. She took me out after work and we stood on the street near Chowpatty beach and she ate three platefuls of papaya. I thought she was constipated. But then we went to Bombelli&#x2019;s and she had three gins as if they were cough syrup. That was when she told me what she was trying to do. &#x201c;Bake the poor thing out of there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It gets too hot inside, the bag squeezes and the baby pops out. I hope.&#x201d; She came to the office the next day and she looked like death warmed over. Apparently, it had worked. &#x201c;Baby, if something like that happens to you, you go and get it D&#x2019;d and C&#x2019;d. It&#x2019;s not worth it,&#x201d; she said to me. And now I say unto you, Sue, and to you too . . .&#x2019; she said, looking at me.</p><p>&#x2018;Me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, you. Not that you&#x2019;re going to get pregnant any which way you turn out. But if you do put a loaf in some poor girl&#x2019;s oven, you will take her to a government place, you will announce that you are Mr and Mrs D&#x2019;Souza &#x2013;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Why D&#x2019;Souza?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. Some name. Any name. Not hers. And after it&#x2019;s done you will take her somewhere to rest and relax and weep and you will stay with her until she can go home.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You mean I&#x2019;m not to tell her to jump down six stairs and give the baby to Our Lady?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You are a wicked young man to laugh at an old lady&#x2019;s guilt,&#x2019; said Em. But she was smiling too.</p><p>� � �</p><p>She was always Em to us. There may have been a time when we called her something ordinary like Mummy, or Ma, but I don&#x2019;t remember. She was Em, and our father, sometimes, was The Big Hoom. Neither Susan nor I, the only persons who might ever care to investigate the matter, can decide how those names came about, though we&#x2019;ve tried (&#x2018;Em must mean M for Mother&#x2019; and &#x2018;Maybe it&#x2019;s because he made &#x201c;hoom&#x201d; sounds when we asked him something&#x2019;). On certain days we called her Doogles, or The Horse, or other such names that sprang from some subterranean source and vanished equally quickly. Otherwise, she was Em, and most of the time she was Em with an exclamation mark.</p><p>Once, by mistake, I called her Mater. I got it out of a Richie Rich comic. The very rich, very snobby Mayda Munny used the word to address her mother. I should have known that I would not get away with something so precious, but I was nine or ten years old and did not know what precious meant. Em peered at me for a moment, pulling deeply on her beedi. (She smoked beedis because they were cheap, she said, and because once you&#x2019;d started down the beedi road, you could never find your way back to the mild taste of cigarettes. The Big Hoom rarely came home from work in the evenings with sweets for us when we were children, but he never forgot the two bundles of Ganesh Chhaap Beedi.)</p><p>&#x2018;Mater,&#x2019; she said, and her eyes shone behind the curls of smoke. &#x2018;Yes, I suppose I am. I did do it, didn&#x2019;t I? And here you stand, living proof.&#x2019;</p><p>I think I blushed. She roared, a happy manic laugh.</p><p>&#x2018;I thought you boys knew everything about the cock and cunt business!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We do,&#x2019; I said, lamely, terrified of where the conversation was going.</p><p>&#x2018;So what did you think, both of you were products of the Immaculate Conception? Gosh, you couldn&#x2019;t keep us out of bed in those first years.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Em!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What? Are you feeling all Oedipal-Shmeedipal then?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s Oedipal?&#x2019;</p><p>Em loved a good story. She was off.</p><p>&#x2018;Ick,&#x2019; I said when Oedipus wandered off, his eyes bleeding and his future uncertain, escorted by his daughter who was also his sister.</p><p>&#x2018;Well you may say &#x201c;Ick&#x201d;,&#x2019; said Em. &#x2018;But that&#x2019;s what Freud says every boy wants to do to his mother. Ick, I say to Mr Freud. He must have been odd, even for an Austrian. Not that I&#x2019;m racist, but why would they have a navy when they&#x2019;re landlocked?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mr Freud was in the navy?&#x2019; I asked, confused.</p><p>&#x2018;No, silly, I&#x2019;m talking about The Sound of Music.&#x2019;</p><p>The Big Hoom came into the bedroom.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re telling the boy about?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The psychoanalytic movement,&#x2019; said Em, her voice slightly defiant.</p><p>&#x2018;Have you got past the id, the ego and the superego?&#x2019; he asked pleasantly.</p><p>&#x2018;I should have started at that end, shouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;At what end did you start?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, I was telling him about the Oedipus Complex.&#x2019;</p><p>The Big Hoom said nothing. He did nothing. He looked at her. She went into a tizzy.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s knowledge, knowledge is good, it will help, knowledge always helps,&#x2019; she said. She was attempting logic. But she was miserable. It was only later that I came to understand why she never used her condition as a refuge: it would have violated her sense of fair play. The Big Hoom let her stew for a bit and then he nodded. He opened The Hamlyn Children&#x2019;s Encyclopaedia, a book that I refused to read because it had been given to Susan as a birthday present, and slowly led me through the facts of life.</p><p>This might have been enough, but my mind was already locked on to what Em had told me. &#x2018;Why do boys want to do that with their mothers?&#x2019; I asked.</p><p>A lesser man might have run shrieking from the question, or told his son to shut up. The Big Hoom taught me the word hypothesis, instead, and explained a little bit about Freud and tried to clear things up. Finally, he set me to making words out of &#x2018;hypothesis&#x2019; and promised me ten paise for every word after the twentieth.</p><p>I loved the word hypothesis. It sounded adult and beautifully alien. I had never heard anything like it before. I wanted more words like it. I felt, instinctively, that when you had enough words like hypothesis, you would be able to deal with the world. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I would ever be able to deal with the world. It seemed too big and demanding and there wasn&#x2019;t a fixed syllabus.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know how to deal with what we were as a family, either. I didn&#x2019;t really know what we were as a family. I only knew that something was wrong with all of us and that it had something to do with my mother and her nerves.</p><p>&#x2018;What are nerves?&#x2019; I had asked The Big Hoom once. I didn&#x2019;t really want to know but a question was a good way to get him to pay attention to me. He put down his newspaper and took me into the gallery. Outside, wires snaked and writhed between the buildings of our housing colony. He pointed to them.</p><p>&#x2018;What are those?&#x2019;</p><p>I hated these moments. I wanted to be told, I did not want to be asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Wires,&#x2019; I said.</p><p>&#x2018;What do wires do?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Electricity?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, they carry electric current,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Nerves do that inside the body.&#x2019;</p><p>Thoughts, like electric currents, and inside my mother&#x2019;s head they ran uncontrolled &#x2013; flashing and sizzling. I carried that image with me through my childhood for what ailed my mother and took her to hospital, sometimes every few months. Then she gave me another.</p><p>� � �</p><p>She was in Ward 33 again, lying in bed, a bed with a dark green sheet and a view of the outside. We could both see a man and a woman getting out of a taxi. They were young and stood for a while, as if hesitating, in front of the hospital. Then the man took the woman&#x2019;s hand in his and they walked into the hospital and we lost them.</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why Indian women fall ill,&#x2019; Em said. &#x2018;So that their husbands will hold their hands.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Is that why you&#x2019;re here?&#x2019;</p><p>I wanted to bite my tongue. I wanted to whiz around the world, my red cape flying, and turn time back so that I could choose not to make that remark. But Em, being Em, was already replying.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, Baba, I don&#x2019;t know why. It&#x2019;s a tap somewhere. It opened when you were born.&#x2019;</p><p>I was repaid in pain, a sharp thing.</p><p>&#x2018;I loved you. And before you I loved Susan, the warmth of her and the smiles and the tiny toes and the miracle of her fingernails and the way her scrapes would fade within the day as she healed and grew. I loved the way her face lit up when she saw me and the way she nursed. But after you came along . . .&#x2019;</p><p>She turned to the window again. An ambulance turned in, lazily, in the way of the city&#x2019;s ambulances. Inured to traffic, unconcerned by mortality, unimpressed by anyone&#x2019;s urgency, the ambulance driver stopped to light a beedi before jumping out of the cab. We watched together as someone inside opened the doors and two young men leapt out and tried to wrest a stretcher from within.</p><p>&#x2018;Was it like that?&#x2019; she asked. She had forgotten how she got to the hospital.</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;You came in a taxi.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What was I wearing?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The green dress with the pockets.&#x2019;</p><p>She looked puzzled.</p><p>I rooted about in the locker by the bed, a locker marked &#x2018;Patient Belonging&#x2019;, and opened it. I pulled the dress out.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh that one,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Bring it here.&#x2019;</p><p>She stroked it as if to rediscover a little more about it.</p><p>&#x2018;The tap?&#x2019; I said.</p><p>&#x2018;Sorry. I must be going mad.&#x2019;</p><p>We both smiled at this, but only a little. It was a tradition: the joke, the smile.</p><p>&#x2018;After you were born, someone turned on a tap. At first it was only a drip, a black drip, and I felt it as sadness. I had felt sad before . . . who hasn&#x2019;t? I knew what it was like....</p></p><h2>Beneath the Apple Leaves</h2><p><b><i>From the author of </i>Daughter of Australia <i>comes a sweeping, heartfelt historical novel that follows a family of German immigrants who trade city living for the harsh realities of Pennsylvania farm life.</i></b><br><br>In 1914, Andrew Houghton&#x2019;s family is one of hundreds eking out an existence in the coal mines of southwestern Pennsylvania.

In 1949 Art and Nan Kellam set off to find their own isolated piece of paradise and eventually settled on a 550-acre island known as Placentia, near Mount Desert Island. They would live there year round for nearly forty years. In this beautifully illustrated volume&#x2015;based on Nan&#x2019;s personal journal and the &#x201c;Big Book,&#x201d; to which both Art and Nan contributed private correspondence and archival materials&#x2015;Peter P. Blanchard III re-creates the story of their island years. He shows their singular devotion to each other, finds tantalizing clues to their reasons for seeking isolation from the rest of the world, and considers the mental and physical toll of such an unusual lifestyle on the individual and joined psyches of the couple. The narrative is beautifully enhanced by historic photographs and by David Graham&#x2019;s recent color photography. While evoking the alluring beauty of Maine&#x2019;s rugged coast, the book celebrates the Kellams&#x2019; courage and determination to follow a distinctive life path. We Were an Island paints a sensitive and sympathetic portrait of a relationship that endured, even prospered, in isolation.</p><p>PETER P. BLANCHARD III is a long-time conservationist and environmental activist, and the founder of Greenwood Gardens, a New Jersey nonprofit organization dedicated to horticulture and environmental education. He owns and manages two Maine islands as nature reserves. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Orion Society, which produces Orion, a bi-monthly magazine dedicated to the issues of nature, culture, and place.Wisconsin State Journal"<br><br>Boston Globe"<br><br>Bangor Daily News"<br><br>If you ve ever been in love, you ve probably turned to your sweetheart and said something like, Darling, you re my everything. Perhaps you ve daydreamed with your significant other about getting away from it all buying a boat, moving to Sweden, moving to Galesnjak somewhere you could live in harmony, just you two and the big blue sky. But Eve can t unbite the apple: it s civilization and other people and I ve got to work late again tonight, honey, and that s life forevermore. And would you really move to nowhere with your someone if you could? Here s a tale of two people who did: Art and Nan Kellam, who married in 1935 and moved to an uninhabited island off the coast of Maine in 1949, where they remained together until 1985. The story has been told before: in a wonderful 2003 Times article and in a series of photographs of the Kellam s homestead, taken by David Graham. But neither of these was complete. In We Were an Island, Peter P. Blanchard III uses Nan s journals, the manuscript of the unfinished book she and Art were writing about their adventure, and their letters and family photos to weave a narrative that is at times touching, at times daunting, at time strangely relatable. Art and Nan led a relatively austere existence, chopping wood, cutting paths through the forest, growing vegetables, rowing to the mainland if they needed special supplies but what comes through in We Were an Island is how inconsequential all this is. The substance of the story is their relationship, which is instantly recognizable to anyone who s ever been in one. Art and Nan had nicknames for each other and made-up words only the two of them knew; they left notes on the door when they stepped out so that the other wouldn t worry; they bickered; Art read aloud to Nan each night.

It is a grand addition to the Maine library. The Working Waterfront What they hoped, Nan wrote in an early journal entry, was to build a simple house and a simple life, to learn to appreciate fundamental things and carry on without the expensive diverting complications of modern civilized existence. <i><b>Wisconsin State Journal</b></i>"<br><br>A new book looks back at the lives of Art and Nan Kellam, who in search of simplicity and solitude, bought an island in 1948. For nearly 40 years, they were the sole inhabitants of the 550-acre Placentia, 2 miles off the northeastern coast of Maine. Before they died, they entrusted the property to the Maine chapter of the Nature Conservancy. In We Were an Island: The Maine Life of Art &amp; Nan Kellam (University of New England), Peter B. Blanchard weaves excerpts from their journals into a narrative of two lives closely tuned to nature. <i><b>Boston Globe</b></i>"<br><br>Source material also came from the Kellams so-called Big Book, which Blanchard described as a collection of private correspondence and archived materials to which both Kellams contributed. [The Big Book] was an eloquent statement of where they were and what they were doing, particularly of their first year, Blanchard said. They had a conscious idea of getting out their story eventually, but they were never able. We Were An Island includes archival photographs of the Kellams and recent photographs of Placentia Island shot by David Graham. <i><b>Bangor Daily News</b></i>"<br><br>The author met Nan late in the Kellams' history on Placentia, and his telling lays the ground for the Kellams to share their experience as it seems they intended. <i><b>Friends of Acadia Journal</b></i>"<br><br>This is an inspirational tale of a dream well lived, a love story of a husband s and wife s search for an independent, simpler life, free from technology, being self-reliant and close to nature. . . . Blanchard has preserved the Kellams character with this wonderful story. <i><b>Kennebec Journal</b></i>"<br><br>[Blanchard] believes the Kellams were normal people who lived simple yet extraordinary lives, deeply devoted to one another, and Placentia. Setting the record straight is one reason he wrote the book. He thinks both Kellams would be tickled with how the book about their dream turned out. I just love to think of what their response would be. <i><b>Mt.

But where Kafka's protagonist turned into a giant beetle, the narrator of Philip Roth's richly conceived fantasy has become a 155-pound female breast. What follows is a deliriously funny yet touching exploration of the full implications of Kepesh's metamorphosis&#x2014;a daring, heretical book that brings us face to face with the intrinsic strangeness of sex and subjectivity.</p><p>"A radical, complex, and moving book...the best example yet of Roth's astonishing prowess when he is at the top of his talent and control." &#x2014;Ted Solotaroff, <i>Esquire</i><br><br>"A new shock world of sensual possibility.... Need one say again that Roth is an admirable novelist who never steps twice into the same river?" &#x2014;Anthony Burgess<br><br>"<b>The Breast</b> is terrific...inventive and sane and very funny. The trick which is the heart of the book is brilliant...and rich with meaning." &#x2014;John Gardner, <i>The New York TImes Book Review</i><br><br>"Hilarious, serious, visionary, logical, sexual-philosophical; the ending amazes&#x2014;the joke takes three steps beyond savagery and satire and turns into a sublimeness of pity.

Topics like beauty, form and content, truthfulness, language, color, light, craftmanship, creativity and collaboration are discussed in the context of faith and art making. The contributors are experienced, successful in their fields and work in areas as diverse as visual art, music, photography and theater. This second edition is significantly enlarged and expanded and lavishly illustrated. It is full color throughout.</p><p>The goal of this book is to provide a deeper discussion of what believers practicing their discipline for God&#x2019;s glory would (or should) look like. Rather than defending the believer&#x2019;s place in the arts&#x2014;which has been done very well in other works&#x2014;this book is intended to be primarily about issues related to making art. <p>The premise of this work is that a Christian looks at the world differently than the non-Christian due to a restored relationship with the Creator. With that restored relationship comes certain responsibilities which are presented in True Spirituality by Francis Schaeffer when he says, "Christians are to demonstrate God&#x2019;s character, which is a moral demonstration, but it is not only to be a demonstration of moral principles; it is a demonstration of His being, His existence." </p><p>This moral demonstration will be worked out in the creative process. If not seen thematically in their work, it will be seen foundationally in their existence. It is not the believers&#x2019; goal to integrate their art with the Faith, rather the art of God&#x2019;s chosen people must spring from faith. Our relationship to our Creator is the one core issue that matters and this relationship gives us the freedom to have "no prescriptions for subject matter," as Hans Rookmaaker says. </p><p>Imagine a Christian sitting down to create a piece of pottery, write a novel, or paint a picture. This believer has decisions to make: color, form, content, theme&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;as well as where they fit into their church and larger community. Of course this book can&#x2019;t dictate things such as, "Paint a red bird&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;write the song in standard time&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;the pot should have three handles&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;" But decisions do need to be made and it is the intent of this book to give the readers ideas to work through so they can develop the internal tools needed to carry out their artwork with a biblical worldview. </p><p>In this way, It Was Good&#x2014;Making Art to the Glory of God will offer both theoretical and practical insights into the making of art from a biblical perspective. And this is crucially important in our age since the area of Beauty is the only point of connection with society since the bridges of Truth and Goodness have been burned. Kuyper&#x2019;s concept of the dual purpose of art to imitate and transcend nature resonates at this point. We as believers in the arts can show through the common grace of art a fleeting picture of Eden. We should not allow the arts to be the sole dominion of the enemies of God but instead we should join with Martin Luther in affirming our desire to see all the arts "in the service of Him who has given and created them."</p>A Christian looks at the world through the eyes of one who has a restored relationship with the Creator, and receives a new vision affecting every area of life--including the creative process. So what does it mean to be a creative individual who is a follower of the creative God? It Was Good: Making Art to the Glory of God seeks to answer that question through a series of essays which offer theoretical and practical insights into artmaking from a Christian perspective. The Christian worldview is foundational to the approach a believer in Christ takes to making art and artmaking inevitably raises difficult questions. This book offers aid in developing some of the internal tools needed to work through those questions, and so to glorify and enjoy God while trying to speak with a clear and relevant voice to a fallen world.</p><h2>Non Non Biyori Vol. 12</h2><p><p><b>Miyauchi Renge</b><br>First grader, the youngest of the five students at Asahigaoka Branch School.

Set in France between 1910 and 1940 and first published in France in 1947, five years after the author&#x2019;s death, <i>All Our Worldly Goods </i>is a gripping story of war, family life and star-crossed lovers. Pierre and Agnes marry for love against the wishes of his parents and his grandfather, the tyrannical family patriarch. Their marriage provokes a family feud that cascades down the generations. This brilliant novel is full of drama, heartbreak, and the telling observations that have made N�mirovsky&#x2019;s work so beloved and admired.</p><p><b>Ir�ne N�mirovsky</b> was born in Kiev in 1903 into a wealthy banking family and immigrated to France during the Russian Revolution. After attending the Sorbonne in Paris, she began to write and swiftly achieved success with <i>David Golder,</i> which was followed by more than a dozen other books. Throughout her lifetime she published widely in French newspapers and literary journals. She died in Auschwitz in 1942. More than sixty years later, <i>Suite Fran�aise</i> was published posthumously for the first time in 2006.1<br><br> They were together, so they were happy. Even though the watchful family slipped between them, separating them gently but firmly, the young man and woman knew they were near one another; nothing else mattered. It was the beginning of the century &#x2013; an autumn evening at the seaside, overlooking the English Channel. Pierre and Agn�s, their parents and Pierre&#x2019;s fianc�e had all gathered to watch the last firework display of summer. On the fine sand of the dunes, the inhabitants of Wimereux-Plage formed dark little groups, barely visible in the starlight. The moist sea air drifted around them. A profound sense of tranquillity reigned over them, and over the sea, and over the world.<br><br> The families were not very friendly to each other, for they belonged to different social classes: the bourgeoisie didn&#x2019;t mingle with the lower middle classes. Each kept its place and its distance with modesty, steadfastness and dignity. Each built itself a fortress out of spades and folding chairs. Each scrupulously respected the possessions of its neighbours and defended its own courteously but resolutely, just as a well-tempered sword bends but does not break. The mothers would murmur, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t touch that, it doesn&#x2019;t belong to you . . . Excuse me, Madame, this is my son&#x2019;s seat and this one is mine . . . Watch your toys or someone will take them.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br> Heavy storm clouds had been gathering all day, but it hadn&#x2019;t rained. Agn�s thought how wonderful it would be to dip her bare feet in the water. But it wasn&#x2019;t done to go into the sea, except at midday and amid a crowd of people, thus somehow preserving a young girl&#x2019;s modesty. She could hear Pierre sighing. He didn&#x2019;t like the heat. He was wearing a dark jacket with a stiff collar; its pale white glow allowed her to make him out in the darkness. He was lying in the hollow of a sand dune, impatiently waving his arms. &#x2018;Pierre, come now, sit still,&#x2019; his mother said, as if he were twelve years old. In fact he was twenty-four, but her tender, authoritarian voice held such power over him that he obeyed her still. Simone, Pierre&#x2019;s fianc�e, sat between him and Agn�s; he turned away to avoid looking at the pale folds of flesh round Simone&#x2019;s waist and her milky-white round arms. This girl looks as if she&#x2019;s made of milk, and butter, and cream, he mused. It was strange; he had often looked with pleasure at her fresh, plump body, her thick, soft waist and red hair. But, for some time now, the sight of her made him feel nauseous, like a meal that is too heavy, too sweet. Nevertheless, they were engaged. The following week, a grand engagement dinner would make it official, uniting the two families. There was no hope for him and Agn�s. So little hope that they hadn&#x2019;t even confessed their love to each other. It was pointless. Pierre Hardelot came from the Hardelot Paper Mills family of Saint-Elme. Agn�s&#x2019;s family were brewers. Only a foreigner, someone from outside, would have thought a marriage between them possible. The people of Saint-Elme had no such illusions; t<i>hey </i>understood, with infallible, subtle tact, how the two young people&#x2019;s different social standing was a barrier. The brewers were from the lower classes and, even worse, they weren&#x2019;t from the region but from Flanders. The Hardelots were from Saint-Elme. There were plenty more obstacles. Pierre should have felt despair, but in spite of everything he was happy. Agn�s was here. They were together. <br><br>The fireworks still hadn&#x2019;t started. The men allowed themselves to relax a little; they stretched out their legs, propped themselves up on their elbows. &#x2018;No one else is lolling about like you,&#x2019; Pierre&#x2019;s mother whispered in his ear. &#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t done.&#x2019; The women sat on the beach as if they were in drawing-room armchairs, backs straight, skirts modestly covering their ankles. If a blade of pale dune grass bent in the wind to tickle their calves, they closed their legs tight, as if ashamed. Their dresses were long and black; their starched linen collars, stiffened with whalebone, restricted their necks, forcing them to turn their heads from side to side with sudden, staccato movements, like hens pecking at worms. When the lighthouse beacon passed you could see their hats, a veritable garden of chiffon and velvet flowers quivering on wire stems. Here and there a stuffed seagull with a pointy beak stood perched on a straw boater. This was the height of fashion, the favourite adornment of the season, though some people found it somewhat daring. There was something unsubtle about that bird, with its little glass eye and extended wings, Pierre&#x2019;s mother thought, as she looked at Agn�s&#x2019;s mother, comparing her neighbour&#x2019;s grey-feathered hat to her own with its decoration of daisies. But Agn�s&#x2019;s mother was from Paris. There were niceties she couldn&#x2019;t sense, couldn&#x2019;t understand.<br><br>Nevertheless, she seemed very anxious to please. &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; she would say, &#x2018;I do agree&#x2019;, or &#x2018;That&#x2019;s what I think as well&#x2019;. But even her humility did not inspire confidence. Everyone knew that, before her marriage, Gabrielle Florent had been forced to work for a living. She herself admitted that she&#x2019;d given singing lessons. Anything was possible. A singing teacher might have socialised with actresses. In spite of everything, she was accepted in Saint-Elme, for, as far as her present conduct was concerned, there was nothing to be said. Yet even though she was accepted, people remained on the defensive.<br><br>It would have been better for Agn�s, for Agn�s&#x2019;s future, if there had been some precise accusation regarding her mother&#x2019;s past, <br>rather than these vague insinuations, people whispering, nodding or sighing as she passed by. &#x2018;Do they have family in Paris? I think this Madame Florent had a bad reputation when she was young. Her daughter will not find a husband so easily. I can&#x2019;t see her getting married. Can you?&#x2019; Monsieur Florent had died three years before. Everyone was surprised that his widow had remained in Saint-Elme. &#x2018;She must have no family left,&#x2019; people said, slightly maliciously; in the eyes of Saint-Elme, the absence of numerous relatives was suspicious. &#x2018;She says she&#x2019;s lost everyone.&#x2019; That was no excuse. A good middle-class �family should be large, and hardy enough to stand up to death.<br><br>&#x2018;The fireworks,&#x2019; shouted the children, &#x2018;the fireworks are starting.&#x2019;<br><br>A golden swirl burst forth from behind the sand dunes and spun over the waves. Everyone stood up in curiosity and pleasure. The inhabitants of Wimereux-Plage rarely indulged in entertainments; they played Ludo in the Casino and, sometimes, touring theatre companies came from Paris. They didn&#x2019;t have to pay to see the fireworks. Sound economic principles reigned supreme here.<br><br>&#x2018;Come over here, Agn�s,&#x2019; said Pierre. &#x2018;Come and stand in front of me, so you can see better . . .&#x2019;<br><br>But when Agn�s went over to him, she found him flanked by his mother and fianc�e. He held out his hand to help her climb on to the sand dune and Madame Hardelot immediately called out to her husband, &#x2018;Charles, stand behind Agn�s. You&#x2019;re so tall! She can&#x2019;t see a thing, can you, darling?&#x2019;<br><br>And so, protected on three sides, Pierre was as defended as a fortress. He pushed the women away rather briskly. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s too hot. I prefer lying in the sand.&#x2019;<br><br>Agn�s didn&#x2019;t dare move. She lowered her head and choked back the tears.<br><br>During the winter the Hardelots and Florents rarely saw each other, even though they were neighbours. The people of Saint-Elme had a remarkable talent for ignoring whatever they didn&#x2019;t wish to know. How well they knew when to become deaf and blind. How tactfully they side-stepped anything they found unpleasant! Families could live next door to one another for twenty years and never even glance at each other. But here, at Wimereux, it was different. In their youth, Agn�s&#x2019;s father and Charles Hardelot had each bought property on the seafront; their chalets were adjoining. It was unfortunate, but as this was a good location, it took precedence over any other factor. They couldn&#x2019;t very well ignore each other. And besides, summer was of no consequence, the Hardelots thought; it was as if their habits, their prejudices, their preconceptions were all part of their environment, their habitat. Once away from home, they became more tolerant, just as certain insects lose their sting once outside the hive. But summer was nearly over. &#x2018;And we&#x2019;ll never see each other again,&#x2019; thought Agn�s. &#x2018;He&#x2019;ll get married and as for me . . . Anyway, does he even love me? He&#x2019;s never told me he does . . . He knows he can&#x2019;t marry me, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be right,&#x2019; she thought. &#x2018;But if he did love me, I&#x2019;d follow him to the ends of the earth.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Look how beautiful it is,&#x2019; said Madame Florent, leaning towards her daughter.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, yes, beautiful,&#x2019; replied Agn�s, her voice trembling, seeing nothing.<br><br> A spray of shooting stars rose towards the sky, then fell back down again, lighting up the crowd; a long whistle sounded as it descended, like a jet of steam. Everyone looked up: Pierre, thin and suntanned, with his wide forehead, small mouth and light-brown moustache; Madame Hardelot, fat, soft and pale; Simone, with her heavy chin. Agn�s automatically imitated the movements of the others; she had a young, thin face, pale skin and dark hair.<br><br> Flames, cornucopias, fiery wheels filled the skies. Then they went out. The night seemed even darker; the air smelled of smoke. Only one little green shooting star, as lost as an orphan, hovered for a moment in the sky before plunging at great speed towards the sand dunes. &#x2018;Oh!&#x2019; the crowd sighed in disappointment, but then other fireworks lit up the east (a cockerel, a fountain, white at first, then tinged with silver, then with red, white and blue) and the crowd showed its joy by crying out a satisfied &#x2018;Ah-ah-ah . . .&#x2019; while the wails of a child rose from the darkness.<br><br>The fountain exploded and fell silent. The last rockets dis�appeared into the sea. The fireworks were over. The Florents and the Hardelots set off for home. Charles Hardelot led the way. His spectacles, set low on his nose, glistened in the beam from the lighthouse. He held his shoes and socks in his hands; he had rolled his trouser legs above his knees. It was difficult to walk in the dunes unless you were barefoot; the hills and valleys of sand were constantly shifting, then re-forming, setting off fine white rivers that crunched inside stockings and ankle boots. It was a constant trial to these ladies; they walked with difficulty, grimacing, leaning against each other. Naturally, the idea of taking off their shoes would never have occurred to them, any more than the idea of removing their corsets. The young women walked alongside their mothers, in silence. Pierre was gone.<br><br> &#x2018;He said he was going over to the Casino before coming home,&#x2019; said Madame Hardelot disapprovingly. Then she whispered in her husband&#x2019;s ear, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t go to bed before he gets back so you know what time he comes in . . .&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Do you want to know what I think?&#x2019; said Charles, in the same tone of voice. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll feel better when we&#x2019;re back in Saint-Elme and Pierre is married. I dislike these excessive seaside distractions,&#x2019; he added, rubbing his thin dry legs; the sand fell from his tight, muscular calves and long, delicate ankles. He put his shoes back on, shaking his head with a worried expression.<br><br> A few street lamps were lit along the road, illuminating the houses set among the sand dunes and pine trees. They had names like &#x2018;My Respite&#x2019;, &#x2018;My Delight&#x2019;, &#x2018;The Swiss Chalet&#x2019; or &#x2018;The Waves&#x2019;. They were all alike, with their high pointed roofs and wooden balconies, their narrow windows decorated with pebbles and seashells. The Hardelots and the Florents had the last two houses. Beyond them, the road turned into a sandy slope. Sand covered the front steps and the garden paths.<br><br> Wimereux was already getting ready for a peaceful night. Here and there, a light flickered behind the shutters, then went out. Each household barricaded itself in to keep out the nocturnal wind, the roaring sea. There was no singing; no shouting: the people of Wimereux were &#x2018;respectable&#x2019;. Further down the coast, a luxury hotel had been built, so they&#x2019;d heard; its guests were gentlemen who dressed for dinner every evening, and ladies who went riding every day. Down there, they danced and gambled until dawn. But no one envied those outsiders. That sort of thing went on far away, or so it seemed, on another planet, one that deserved neither interest nor consideration of any sort. As they went inside, the families exchanged long, ceremonious goodbyes. Sleepy child�ren were dragged along by the hand. In single file, they climbed the pale wooden steps that smelled of sap and honey. Simone went into her room; it was between Pierre&#x2019;s grandfather&#x2019;s room and his parents&#x2019; bedroom. Pierre slept on a different floor, as far away from his fianc�e as possible, so as not to arouse the slightest suspicion about the fact that a young man and young woman were living under the same roof. Doors were bolted; windows locked; they checked under the beds. In their peaceful universe, these people saw danger everywhere, pitfalls of every kind.<br><br> In her room, Agn�s lifted a corner of the curtain, looking down the road for Pierre. She was very careful not to be seen. What a scandal it would be if anyone suspected she wasn&#x2019;t asleep, that she was waiting...for whom? Someone else&#x2019;s fianc�. He wasn&#x2019;t there. A soft but thick fog rose from the sea. It was early September; you could smell autumn now. The air had lost its warmth, become damp and bitter. She waited. It was nearly midnight. One by one, the street lamps went out. At midnight, all of Wimereux was asleep. Finally, finally, she heard the long creak of the little wooden door, pushed open by Pierre. He was home. He wasn&#x2019;t coming home to her, but to Simone; yet in spite of everything he was home. She stood beside the window for a moment longer, gently removing the pins that held up her long hair. The beach, the sea, were invisible, covered in mist. All that could be heard was a very faint murmur wafting up from the waves, like the sound of someone sighing.</p><h2>Love as Always, Mum xxx: The true and terrible story of surviving a childhood with Fred and Rose West</h2><p><br>'A CHILLING new memoir by the daughter of mass murderer Fred West and his wife Rose describes the savage cruelty of her upbringing in 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester'<b> DAILY MAIL</b><br><br>'Mae, I mean this ...

It is the law that minors can commit their parents to a Soberlife facility, as 14-year-old Sam has had to do with his mother in the hope of shielding his younger brother Ollie from her disease. The control which Sam exerts over the lives around him is monumental but has left him with no life of his own. In the end he finds that controlling others is only an illusion, and that Ollie has not been shielded but deeply wounded by his family's deception. The final note of this depressing scenario, however, is a hopeful one. Sam and his mother reveal themselves to each other for the first time and bond together in love and acceptance. The plot has many messages but is not overburdened. The characters of Sam, Ollie, and their mother are vivid, and the sense of foreboding surrounding Ollie's actions carries readers as the point of view shifts with each chapter. A strong story that delivers the chilling realization that the future which Brooks portrays is not very distant. --Nancy Curtin, Port Washington Public Library, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trumpet on the Land: The Aftermath of Custer&#39;s Massacre, 1876</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Terry Johnston is an authentic American treasure.&#x201d;&#x2014;Loren D. Estleman, author of </b><i><b>Edsel</b></i><br><br>It was a day that shocked a nation. June 25, 1876. The day General George Armstrong Custer fell at Little Big Horn. Now the U.S. Army is on the march. Vowing revenge, its commanders have declared total war on the Cheyenne and Sioux. Every able-bodied man must answer the call of the cavalry trumpet . . . men such as frontiersman Buffalo Bill Cody and scout Seamus Donegan. From the Black Hills to Slim Buttes, from Yellowstone to Warbonnet Creek, some would succumb to ambush, some to starvation, others to disease and even madness. Under the blood-red sun of that terrible summer, Seamus Donegan prays only to survive . . . to return to his wife, Samantha, and witness the birth of their first child.</p><p><b>Terry C. Johnston&nbsp;</b>is recognized as a master of the American historical novel. His grand adventures of the American West combine the grace and beauty of a natural storyteller with complete dedication to historical accuracy and authenticity. Johnston was born the first day of 1947 on the plains of Kansas, and lived all his life in the American West. His first novel,&nbsp;<i>Carry the Wind</i>,&nbsp;won the Medicine Pipe Bearer Award from the Western Writers of America, and his subsequent books have appeared on bestseller lists throughout the country.

He had his canvas britches snugged in loose rolls all the way up to his knees to soak in the refreshing current. &#x201c;You see, I never water down my whiskey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The half-breed with skin the hue of coffee-tanned leather tied off his army mount, then came over to settle in the shade of a huge cottonwood beside Donegan. &#x201c;Much as you bellyache about missing your whiskey this trip out, you sure as hell done a lot of soaking in water.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Seamus grinned, then nodded in agreement as he said, &#x201c;This tends to take a man&#x2019;s mind off his real thirst.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The sort a man gets when he has a whiskey hunger, eh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Or the kind of hunger what hits a man when he&#x2019;s gone without a woman for too long.&#x201d; Donegan immediately felt bad for the thoughtless words that fell from his tongue. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Frank. Didn&#x2019;t mean nothing by it. Forgot, is all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard waved it off with a lukewarm grin and a shrug of his shoulder. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make nothing of it, Irishman. Women been nothing but trouble for me. Whiskey too. Now, a fella like you, he can handle both, I&#x2019;d wager: all he wants of both. But a man like me gets all buried in a woman, and that makes for trouble with that woman&#x2019;s brother&#x2014;so that&#x2019;s when I go and get all fall-down and underfoot with some cheap Red River trader&#x2019;s whiskey....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He heard the head scout&#x2019;s voice fade away while watching the wistful look come over the half-breed&#x2019;s dusky, molasses-colored face. &#x201c;I figure we ought to talk about what brung you to look me up&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It don&#x2019;t matter no more, Seamus,&#x201d; Grouard interrupted. &#x201c;Something I can talk about now. Hurt for a while. Not so much no more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Damn, but you&#x2019;ve had your share of dark days. First the trouble with Sitting Bull&#x2019;s Hunkpapas over them whiskey traders. Then you go and get yourself all but scalped and skewered over a woman with Crazy Horse&#x2019;s band.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean for things to turn out so bad with He Dog, that woman&#x2019;s brother, bad with the rest of them Hunkpatila that way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As much as Crook&#x2019;s chief of scouts might protest otherwise, Seamus could still read the torment of that lost love carved into the lines around Grouard&#x2019;s eyes. Just the way it had to be cut into his very soul. &#x201c;Never knew a man who lost a woman could honestly claim he was meaning for things to turn out that way, Frank.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard pulled free a long brilliant-green stem from the grass at his side, placed it between his lips, and sucked absently, gazing at the gurgling flow of Little Goose Creek at their feet. Moment by moment the midsummer sun continued its relentless climb toward midsky, easing back the cool, inviting shadows beneath the overhanging cotton woods like a woman at her morning chores sweeping against a thickening line of dust across her hardwood floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Crook&#x2019;s changed his mind, Irishman,&#x201d; Grouard finally said, sliding the green grass blade from his lips.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For sure this time?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He nodded. &#x201c;When he called off us going on our scout last night like he&#x2019;d wanted original&#x2019;, I just figured the general wanted time to set his mind on something. But this morning he told me he didn&#x2019;t want to take the chance of losing me, losing any of us right now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame him, do you? What with all but a handful of them Shoshone up and pulling out for home this morning? Why, just two days back even the Crow saw the elephant and left us on the trail so they could hurry back to their villages and have their scalp dances. So now, by God, with the Snakes gone too, the old man&#x2019;s been left stranded.&#x201d; He wagged his head dolefully. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t no wonder that Crook&#x2019;s afraid the enemy could be all around us, now that he ain&#x2019;t got his Injun scouts to be his eyes and ears. But there&#x2019;s no way to know for sure what&#x2019;s out there, all around us now, if we don&#x2019;t go out and scout.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Them war camps still ain&#x2019;t strong enough to jump us here,&#x201d; Frank replied sourly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe they won&#x2019;t jump us, but they sure been making a bunch of trouble for us while we sit and wait. Crook&#x2019;s gotta know that by now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;General knows.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So he wants us just to sit on our saddle galls?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard grinned. &#x201c;Why the hell you complaining, white man? Looks like you&#x2019;re getting in all the feet soaking you want, Seamus.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Think about it. While Crook&#x2019;s army sits, what you suppose the Injun camps are doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard&#x2019;s eyes narrowed thoughtfully on the distance, as if he were attempting to measure somehow the sheer heft to all that danger out there. As if he might actually try to divine the enemy&#x2019;s intent across that great gulf in time and space.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re hunting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hunting meat?&#x201d; Seamus replied. &#x201c;Or hunting soldiers?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Both. While they&#x2019;ll hunt for hides and meat to put up for the winter&#x2014;they damn sure gonna keep an eye on us here. Send scouts down to watch Crook&#x2019;s camp all the time so they&#x2019;ll know if we go to marching north again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That has to be a big camp, Grouard. I can&#x2019;t figure &#x2019;em staying together for much longer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me neither,&#x201d; Frank agreed, sweeping the grass aside with his fingers so that he could scoop up a palmful of dirt. &#x201c;That many lodges, that many people, thousands and thousands of ponies&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll need to break up.&#x201d; With a flick of his wrist he sprayed the dust out from his hand in a wide arc.<br> &nbsp;<br> Donegan said, &#x201c;But Crook&#x2019;s got it set firm in his mind he&#x2019;s gonna have to tangle with the whole bunch again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He does figure on that&#x2014;so he don&#x2019;t fed much like moving till he&#x2019;s got more men and bullets.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Donegan rocked off his elbow and eased his head back onto the grass. The sun felt as good as a man could ever want it to feel&#x2014;every bit as good as he had dreamed the summer sun could feel on his skin while he struggled vainly to stay warm shuddering atop a cold saddle last winter on Reynolds&#x2019;s long march north to the fight on Powder River.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here in the heart of summer, Seamus sighed with contentment and said, &#x201c;If Crook&#x2019;s waiting for men and bullets&#x2014;then this army of his ain&#x2019;t gonna be marching anytime soon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mean you and me won&#x2019;t be working.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At that moment he wanted to crack one of his eyes into a slit so he could weigh the look on the half-breed&#x2019;s face, to see if Grouard was trying to skin him or not. But Seamus fought the sudden impulse down like it were a real thing, not wanting to move at all from this warm, sundrenched creekbank. &#x201c;Little while back you said Crook&#x2019;s changed his mind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He has.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard answered, &#x201c;But it don&#x2019;t mean Crook can&#x2019;t go and change his mind again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thinking back on all the generals he had known since 1862, Seamus had to agree. &#x201c;Seems like that sort of thing just naturally comes with those stars, don&#x2019;t it, Frank? Like it&#x2019;s their duty to up and change your mind. Mither of God! But that&#x2019;s the sole province of a general: this right to change one&#x2019;s mind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Crook&#x2019;s the general hereabouts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What of those columns off to the north of us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard shrugged. &#x201c;Lots of Injuns between us and them. Like I told you last night: there&#x2019;s a hundred miles stuffed right up to the bunghole with badass Lakota and Shahiyena warriors all wanting white scalps.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And especially your hair&#x2014;for you leading sojurs down on them twice now.&#x201d; Donegan brooded a moment, then asked, &#x201c;What all do you think the Lakota are up to, if them camps really are out to hunt like you say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Figure they have scouts keeping an eye on them other columns too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How is it Gibbon&#x2019;s Montana sojurs, or Terry&#x2019;s Dakota column from over at Fort Lincoln, haven&#x2019;t run onto a village that size yet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You asking about Terry&#x2019;s column&#x2014;that bunch what Crook says is pushing this way with Custer&#x2019;s cavalry riding right out front?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, them. Why hasn&#x2019;t Terry&#x2019;s sojurs run up against that big camp what jumped us three days back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grouard shrugged. &#x201c;Just lucky, I suppose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Naw. It ain&#x2019;t just luck, Frank. Way I see it&#x2014;them warriors will keep right on doing their best to keep their women and children out of the army&#x2019;s way. Reason they rode south to jump us was they didn&#x2019;t want Crook&#x2019;s army getting anywhere near their village. They&#x2019;ll go and do the same thing with that bunch up north: keep well out of the way of Gibbon and Terry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He studied Donegan a moment. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think so, Irishman. Way it lays out to me is this: a village that big won&#x2019;t be worried about a damned thing but finding enough grass to feed all their ponies.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So&#x2014;what about them sojurs up north of us? You&#x2019;re saying that war camp hit us on the Rosebud just don&#x2019;t give a damn about the three columns closing in on &#x2019;em?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His face a mask of disgust, Grouard slowly brought his two hands together. &#x201c;Only two columns still closing in now, Irishman.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So either of them other two expeditions. Why you figure neither of them bumped into that goddamned big village themselves yet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With a slow wag of his head Grouard said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say, Seamus. Only ... I know one thing&#x2019;s certain as rain: it&#x2019;s just a matter of time before Custer and his men run smack up against more&#x2019;n they can handle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Young Adult Literature: From Romance to Realism, Third Edition</h2><p>Cart's authoritative survey is already a go-to text for students of literary studies, teachers, and YA staff.

Saulitis revels in the nostalgia and secret pleasures that come from knowing it's all fleeting. She searches for answers from European poets and Buddhist scholars, from women in treatment chat rooms, from family, from routine; she looks out into the wilderness, at the salmon dying in the river without the ease of morphine, at stone structures broken from water freezing, expanding inside. Becoming Earth is the account of a woman living life in the presence of death, trying to make sense of a world that will keep going, even though she won't.</p></p><p>Essayist, poet, and marine biologist Eva Saulitis for nearly thirty years studied killer whales in Prince William Sound, along with her partner Craig Matkin. Her first book, Leaving Resurrection: Chronicles of a Whale Scientist (Boreal Books/Red Hen Press), considers questions science did not allow her to ask. Her second nonfiction book, Into Great Silence (Beacon), deals with the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the orcas she studied.

In <i>Becoming Earth</i>, Eva Saulitis cites Keats&#x2019; definition of negative capability, &#x2018;the capacity to remain in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.&#x2019; She takes herself beyond that restrictive, narrow definition, by acknowledging the terrible facts and reasons for her life&#x2019;s rapid winding down. But she never lets go of mystery, never stops looking out into the world and looking into the words of other writers that help her live with uncertainties. Eva Saulitis has a remarkable ability to pivot from hard circumstance to an insistence that we be aware of the rich world she loves. Through the gift of her words, she has made a rich life those who read her will continue to inhabit.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2015;Frank Soos, author of <i>Unpleasantries</i></p> <br> <p>&#x201c;Eva Saulitis&#x2019;s <i>Becoming Earth</i> is a glorious book. It begins with cancer and then, in elegant prose, unfolds into a meditation on wildness, until it is brimming at its banks with wonder. Never falsely wise, and never ever sentimental or brave, Saulitis left me breathless with realization. Her reflections on human hair, on the differences between restoration and recovery, on the nuances of human relationship as spouses navigate cancer, all surprised and startled me, but the core image of the book is that of a salmon stream stinking with dead and dying fish. Only a wildlife biologist could see in that stream the charged and lovely overflow of life that made it&#x2015;and see also that the cancer inside her is of the same remarkable wildness. This is spiritual work without any pretense to spirituality. It is what the Buddha would have written had he been trained in wildlife biology. <i>Becoming Earth</i> leaves you, strangely, feeling released, and grateful, and receptive to the world.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2015;Kent Meyers, author of <i>The Work of Wolves</i></p></p><h2>A Certain Scientific Railgun Vol. 14</h2><p><p><b>WHO WANTS TO BE A BILLIONAIRE?</b><br><b></b><br>Academy City&#x2019;s newest corrections facility offers a dark bargain: The Jailbreak Challenge.

(Exodus 33:11).</p> <p>Is it possible to talk with God as Moses did face to face? This is not only what we long for, but what God also ardently desires. For Moses that may have meant an actual physical encounter, but for most of us it is an expression that suggests friendship, open communication, honesty, and the conversations of familiarity. But how is that done? And how can we learn how God speaks to us individually? Bestselling author S. Michael Wilcox explores the scriptural expressions and concepts of ''pouring out,'' ''wrestling,'' being ''filled with desire,'' and ''knocking'' at the door Jesus promised would open to us particularly in those times when we deeply need heaven to hear us and to confirm to our souls that more than our words are being received.</p></p><p><p>S.

Twenty-eight ingenious projects that actually worked, even if only in theory, or even if only once (including a couple that imploded upon debut), are presented in four-page spreads. Brief, breezy narratives cover basic background information, historical context, and public reaction. The most fascinating features, however, are the detailed, captioned drawings with cutaways and arrows that show the step-by-step mechanics behind several creations. Add cheeky cartoon spreads of each gizmo's imagined first public appearance, in appropriate time and place, including onlookers' sometimes amazed but usually unimpressed and rather irreverent commentary, and middle-grade readers should be hooked.

Pride of place goes, of course, to Leonardo da Vinci, though other eccentric visionaries such as Heron of Alexandria (a mysteriously self-opening door) and Nikola Tesla (planetwide wireless electric power) earn nods. Along with a squadron of vehicles that would (supposedly) fly or float into the air, the authors present a variety of ancient timepieces, including one that used scents, oddball vehicles driven by steam, a device that sorts small candies by color, the once-renowned chess-playing (fake) automaton known as the 'Mechanical Turk,' an LP record made of ice, a flatulence deodorizer, and like oddities. Nearly all of these saw at least experimental models&#x2015;though, in the case of Leonardo's ornithopter, not until 2010. The entries are arranged in no particular order. Most come with labeled schematic illustrations of the invention and, on the following pages, a broader cityscape or other scene featuring witnesses offering humorous comments or critical observations ('We forgot to add brakes!').

Originally published in 1932 in France, <i>Les Vases communicants</i> is an effort to show how the discoveries and techniques of surrealism could lead to recovery from despondency. This English translation makes available "the theories upon which the whole edifice of surrealism, as Breton conceived it, is based." <p>In <i>Communicating Vessels</i> Breton lays out the problems of everyday experience and of intellect. His involvement with political thought and action led him to write about the relations between nations and individuals in a mode that moves from the quotidian to the lyrical. His dreams triggered a curious correspondence with Freud, available only in this book. As Caws writes, "The whole history of surrealism is here, in these pages."</p></p><p>Mary Ann Caws is Distinguished Professor of French, English, and Comparative Literature at the Graduate School of the City University of New York.

One poignant poem, &#34;The Writer,&#34; addresses this through his reaction to listening outside the door as his daughter earnestly struggles to compose a story on her typewriter: &#34;It is always a matter, my darling/Of life or death, as I had forgotten. I wish/ What I wished you before, but harder.&#34; The collection won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1989.<p>RICHARD WILBUR, one of America&#x2019;s most beloved poets, has served as poet laureate of the United States.

Fear glittered in the woman&#x2019;s moist eyes as she shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Ohmygod, she can&#x2019;t feel it!&#x201d;</p><p>Alan turned to the daughter. Her face was the same shade of off-white as the curtains surrounding and isolating them from the rest of the emergency room.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you wait outside for just a minute, please.&#x201d; He made sure his tone would indicate that he was not making a request.</p><p>The daughter found the slit in the curtains and disappeared.</p><p>Alan turned back to the mother and studied her as she lay on the gurney in the fluorescent-lit limbo, letting his mind page through what he remembered of Helen Jonas. Not much. Borderline diabetes and mild essential hypertension. She hadn&#x2019;t been to the office for two years, and on that occasion had been dragged in by her daughter. Then, half an hour ago, Alan had been sitting at home reading a journal when a call came from the emergency room that one of his patients had arrived, unable to walk or talk.</p><p>He&#x2019;d made his diagnosis within minutes of seeing her, but followed through with the rest of the examination. He moved the needle to the back of Helen&#x2019;s right hand.</p><p>&#x201c;How about this?&#x201d;</p><p>Again she shook her head.</p><p>He leaned over and touched the point to her left hand and she jerked it away. He then ran his thumbnail up from her bare right heel along the sole of her foot. The toes flared upward. He raised her right hand and told her to squeeze. The fingers didn&#x2019;t move. He let go and the arm dropped back to the mattress like dead meat.</p><p>&#x201c;Smile,&#x201c; he said, showing her a toothy grin.</p><p>The lady tried to imitate him, but only the left half of her face responded. Her right cheek and the right side of her mouth remained immobile.</p><p>&#x201c;How about the eyebrows?&#x201d; He oscillated his own, Groucho Marx style.</p><p>Both of the woman&#x2019;s eyebrows moved accordingly.</p><p>He listened to her heart and to her carotid arteries&#x2014;normal rhythm, no murmur, no bruits.</p><p>Alan straightened up.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a stroke, Helen. An artery&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He heard the daughter say, &#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; behind the curtain, but he continued speaking. He would deal with her later. The main thing now was to reassure Helen.</p><p>&#x201c;An artery on the left side of your brain has blocked off and you&#x2019;ve lost the power on the right side of your body.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice came through the curtain again: &#x201c;Ohmygod, I knew it! She&#x2019;s paralyzed!&#x201d;</p><p>Why didn&#x2019;t she shut up? He knew the daughter was frightened, and he could appreciate that, but the daughter was not his primary concern at the moment, and she was only making a bad situation worse for her mother.</p><p>&#x201c;How long it will last, Helen, I don&#x2019;t know. You&#x2019;ll probably get some strength back; maybe all of it, and maybe none. Exactly how much and exactly how soon are impossible to say right now.&#x201d;</p><p>He put her good hand in his. She squeezed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to get you upstairs right now and start running some tests in the morning. We&#x2019;ll start some physical therapy, too. We&#x2019;ll take good care of you and check out the rest of you while you&#x2019;re here. The stroke is over and done with. So don&#x2019;t waste time worrying about it. It&#x2019;s history. From now on you work on getting back use of that arm and leg.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled lopsidedly and nodded. Finally he pulled his hand away and said, &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned and stepped through the curtains to where the daughter was talking to the air.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatamygonnadoo? I gotta call Charlie! I gotta call Rae! Whatamygonnadoo?&#x201d;</p><p>Alan put his hand on her shoulder and gave her trapezius a gentle squeeze. She flinched and stopped her yammering.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna clam up, okay?&#x201d; he said in a low voice. &#x201c;All you&#x2019;re doing is upsetting her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But whatamygonnadoo? I&#x2019;ve got so much to do! I gotta&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He squeezed again, a little harder. &#x201c;The most important thing for you to do right now is go stand by her and tell her how she&#x2019;s going to come stay with you for a while after she gets out of the hospital and how you&#x2019;re going to have everybody over for Easter.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared at him. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean she&#x2019;s going to be coming home?&#x201d;</p><p>Alan smiled and nodded. &#x201c;Yeah. After a little stay in rehab. She thinks she&#x2019;s going to die here. She&#x2019;s not. But she needs someone holding her hand now and talking about the near future, how life&#x2019;s going to go on and how she&#x2019;s going to be part of it.&#x201d; He steered her toward the curtains. &#x201c;Get in there.&#x201d;</p><p>McClain, head nurse for the ER, pushing sixty and built like the Berlin Wall, saw him from the desk and held a tPA package with a questioning look. The CT scan had shown no bleed, but from what he&#x2019;d gathered from the daughter, the stroke had occurred more than three hours ago. That eliminated tPA as an option.</p><p>Alan signed the orders, wrote the admitting note, then dictated the history and physical.</p><p>After giving final reassurances and saying good night to Helen Jonas and her daughter, Alan finally got out of the hospital, into his Subaru Outback, and on his way back home. He drove slowly, taking the short route through downtown Monroe where all the buildings clustered around the tiny harbor like anxious bathers waiting for a signal from the lifeguard. He liked the solitude of a late night drive through the shopping district. During the day the streets would be stop and go all the way. But at this hour, especially now that all the construction was done and he didn&#x2019;t have to dodge excavations or follow detour signs, he could cruise, adjusting his speed so he could hit the lights just right. A smooth ride, now that the trolley tracks had been covered with asphalt. He pushed a CD into the player and The Crows came on, singing &#x201c;Oh, Gee.&#x201d;</p><p>He watched the clapboarded shop fronts slip by. He hadn&#x2019;t been in favor of the downtown restoration at first when the Village Council&#x2014;why did Long Island towns insist on calling themselves villages?&#x2014;decided to redo the harbor front in a nineteenth-century whaling motif. Never mind that any whaling in this vicinity of the North Shore had been centered to the east in places like Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor, the village wanted a make over. Passing the newly faced seafood restaurants, clothing stores, and antique shops, Alan had to admit they looked good. The former lackluster hodgepodge of storefronts had taken on a new, invigorated personality, fitting perfectly with the white-steepled First Presbyterian Church and the brick-fronted town hall. Monroe was now something more than just another of the larger towns along Long Island&#x2019;s &#x201c;Preferred North Shore.&#x201d;</p><p>The illusion almost worked. He tried to picture Ishmael, harpoon on shoulder, walking down to the harbor toward the Pequod... passing the new Blockbuster.</p><p>Well, nothing was perfect.</p><p>A red light finally caught him and he pulled to a stop. As he waited he watched Clubfoot Annie&#x2014;the closest thing Monroe had to a shopping bag lady&#x2014;hobble across the street in front of him. Alan had no idea of her real name and, so far as he knew, neither did anybody else. She was known to everyone simply as Clubfoot Annie.</p><p>He was struck now, as he was whenever he saw her, by how a misshapen foot that no one had bothered to correct on a child could shape the life of the adult. People like Annie always managed to get to Alan, making him want to go back in time and see to it that someone did the right thing. So simple... some serial casting on her infant equinovarus deformity would have straightened it out to normal. Who would Annie be today if she&#x2019;d grown up with a normal foot? Maybe she&#x2014;</p><p>Something slammed against the right front door, jolting Alan, making him jump in his seat. A ravaged caricature of a human face pressed against the passenger door window.</p><p>&#x201c;You!&#x201d; the face said as it rolled back and forth against the glass. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one! Lemme in! Gotta talk t&#x2019;ya!&#x201d;</p><p>His hair and beard were long and knotted and as filthy as his clothes. The eyes shone but gave no evidence of intelligence. What ever mind he had must have been pickled a long time ago. The man straightened up and pulled on the door handle, but it was locked. He moved along the side of the car toward the hood. He looked like a Bowery derelict. Alan could not remember ever seeing the likes of him in Monroe.</p><p>He crossed in front of the car, pointing at Alan over the hood, all the while babbling unintelligibly. Tense but secure, Alan waited until the man was clear of the front of the car, then he gently accelerated. The man pounded his fist once on the trunk as the car left him behind.</p><p>In the rearview mirror, Alan saw him start running behind the car, then stop and stand in the middle of the street, staring after him, a picture of dejection and frustration as he waved his arms in the air and then let them flop down to his sides.</p><p>The episode left Alan shaken. He glanced at the passenger window and was startled to see a large oily smudge in the shape of the derelict&#x2019;s face. As it picked up the light of a passing street lamp, it seemed to look at him, reminding him uncomfortably of the face from the Shroud of Turin.</p><p>He was pulling up to another red light when his beeper chittered, startling him into jamming on his brakes. He checked the illuminated readout:</p><p>Call Mrs. Nash re: son. Abd pain and vomiting. The phone number followed.</p><p>Alan straightened in his seat. Sylvia Nash&#x2014;he knew her well; a concerned parent but not an alarmist. If she was calling, it meant something was definitely wrong with J...</p></p><h2>Woman Rebel: The Margaret Sanger Story</h2><p><p><b>The alternative-comics master offers an indelible and idiosyncratic take on the protofeminist</b><br><b>"[<i>Woman Rebel</i>] is fine work from an excellent cartoonist and I urge you to jump right in."-Tom Spurgeon of <i>The Comics Reporter</i>, from his introduction</b> </p><p>Peter Bagge's <i>Woman Rebel: The Margaret Sanger Story</i> is a dazzling and accessible biography of the social and political maverick, jam-packed with fact and fun. In his signature cartoony, rubbery style, Bagge presents the life of the birth-control activist, educator, nurse, mother, and protofeminist from her birth in the late nineteenth century to her death after the invention of the birth control pill. Balancing humor and respect, Bagge makes Sanger whole and human, showing how her flaws fueled her fiery activism just as much as her compassionate nature did. Sanger's life takes on a whole new vivacity as Bagge creates a fast-paced portrait of a trailblazer whose legacy as the founder of Planned Parenthood is still incredibly relevant, important, and inspiring.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Bagge</b> is the Harvey Award&#x2013;winning author of the acclaimed nineties alternative-comic series Hate, starring slacker hero Buddy Bradley, and a regular contributor to <i>Reason</i> magazine.

During this time the corrupt Santa Anna rose to power. A dishonest and ruthless politician, thief, compulsive gambler, opium addict and liar, he nevetheless gained a measure of popular support and set about destroying federalism. Conflict with the American settlers ('Texians') became inevitable, a conflict which included the legendary Battle of the Alamo.

The Epistle of Barnabas is a homily on the mistaken Judaistic conception of the Old Testament. The Epistles consist of a covering note and a letter, which is an exhortation to the Philippians on Christian life in general. The Martyrdom of St. Polycarp is the story of this bishop of Smyrna&#39;s death at the hand of the Roman authorities in Asia for the defense of the Christian faith. The Fragments of Papias. Papias, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, was the author of five books, entitled Exegesis of the Lord&#39;s Gospel. The Epistle to Diognetus is an apology for Christianity, presented by an unknown writer to a pagan of high social or political rank.</p><p>The Didache purports to be an instruction based on sayings of the Lord and given by the Twelve Apostles to pagans who wished to become Christians.Sharon Newman has written several books on quiltmaking and quilt history and is nationally recognized for her reproduction fabric lines from Moda(R) fabrics. <br> <br>Walter J.

From the pressing need to avoid &#34;losing face&#34; to the urge to scapegoat and blame, from the desire to exclude those who are different to the horrors of ethnic cleansing, from the obsession with body image to the abiding terrors of the abused, shame is a universal phenomenon. It transcends boundaries of time and is evident in diverse cultures across the world. It is, furthermore, found throughout the pages of Scripture, yet in modern theology shame is conspicuous by its absence. This book attempts to redress the balance by exploring the theology of shame, from its inception in the garden of Eden, to the final triumph over shame on the cross. Restoring the Shamed will offer readers the opportunity to think theologically about one of the most urgent, yet strangely secret, issues of contemporary society.</p><p></p><h2>The Disappearances</h2><p><i>What if the ordinary things in life suddenly...disappeared?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Aila Quinn&#x2019;s mother, Juliet, has always been a mystery: vibrant yet guarded, she keeps her secrets beyond Aila&#x2019;s reach.

Rodriguez argues that America has been brown since its inception-since the moment the African and the European met within the Indian eye. But more than simply a book about race, <b>Brown</b> is about America in the broadest sense&#x2014;a look at what our country is, full of surprising observations by a writer who is a marvelous stylist as well as a trenchant observer and thinker.</p><p>"The best American essayist."<br><b>&#x2014;<b>Village Voice</b><p><b>Richard Rodriguez</b> works as an editor at the Pacific News Service in San Francisco and is a contributing editor for <b>Harper's</b> magazine and the Sunday "Opinion" section of the <b>Los Angeles Times</b>. He appears regularly as an essayist on the <b>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</b> on PBS.</p></b>Chapter One<p>The Triad of Alexis de Tocqueville</p><p>Two women and a child in a glade beside a spring. Beyond them, the varnished wilderness wherein bright birds cry. The child is chalk, Europe's daughter. Her dusky attendants, a green Indian and a maroon slave.</p><p>The scene, from Democracy in America, is discovered by that most famous European traveler to the New World, Alexis de Tocqueville, aristocratic son of the Enlightenment, liberal, sickly, gray, violet, lacking the vigor of the experiment he has set himself to observe.</p><p>"I remember . . . I was traveling through the forests which still cover the state of Alabama. . . ."</p><p>In a clearing, at some distance, an Indian woman appears first to Monsieur, followed by a "Negress," holding by the hand "a little white girl of five or six years."</p><p>The Indian: "A sort of barbarous luxury" set off her costume; "rings of metal were hanging from her nostrils and ears, her hair, which was adorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders. . . ." The Negress wore "squalid European garments."</p><p>Such garments are motifs of de Tocqueville's pathos. His description intends to show the African and the Indian doomed by history in corresponding but opposing ways. (History is a coat cut only to the European.)</p><p>"The young Indian, taking the child in her arms, lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers give, while the Negress endeavored, by various little artifices, to attract the [child's] attention. . . ."</p><p>The white child "displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of superiority that formed a strange contrast with her infantine weakness; as if she received the attentions of her companions with a sort of condescension."</p><p>Thus composed: The Indian. The Negress. The white child.</p><p>". . . In the picture that I have just been describing there was something peculiarly touching; a bond of affection here united the oppressors with the oppressed, and the effort of Nature to bring them together rendered still more striking the immense distance placed between them by prejudice and the laws."</p><p>At Monsieur's approach, this natural colloquy is broken. He becomes the agent of history. Seeing him, the Indian suddenly rises, "push[es] the child roughly away and, giving [Monsieur] an angry look, plunge[s] into the thicket."</p><p>The Negress rests; awaits de Tocqueville's approach.</p><p>Neither response satisfies the European. The African, de Tocqueville writes, has lost the memory of ancestors, of custom and tongue; the African has experienced degradation to his very soul, has become a true slave. "Violence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the thoughts and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants more than he hates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of those who oppress him."</p><p>The bejeweled Indian, alternately, is "condemned . . . to a wandering life, full of inexpressible sufferings," because European interlopers have unbalanced the provender of Nature.</p><p>And, de Tocqueville remarks (a fondness for fable), whereas the Negro's response to mistreatment is canine, the Indian's is feline. "The Negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself among men who repulse him. . . ." The Indian is filled with diffidence toward the white, "has his imagination inflated with the pretended nobility of his origin, and lives and dies in the midst of these dreams of pride." The Indian refuses civilization; the African slave is rendered unfit for it.</p><p>But cher Monsieur: You saw the Indian sitting beside the African on a drape of baize. They were easy together. The sight of them together does not lead you to wonder about a history in which you are not the narrator?</p><p>These women are but parables of your interest in yourself. Rather than consider the nature of their intimacy, you are preoccupied alone with the meaning of your intrusion. You in your dusty leather boots, cobbled on the rue du Faubourg St.-Honor&#x17d;. Your tarnished silver snuffbox, your saddlebag filled with the more ancient dust of books. You in your soiled cambric. Vous-m&amp;ecireme.</p><p>A boy named Buddy came up beside me in the schoolyard. I don't remember what passed as prologue, but I do not forget what Buddy divulged to me: If you're white, you're all right;<br>If you're brown, stick around;<br>If you're black, stand back.<br></p><p>It was as though Buddy had taken me to a mountaintop and shown me the way things lay in the city below.</p><p>In Sacramento, my brown was not halfway between black and white. On the leafy streets, on the east side of town, where my family lived, where Asians did not live, where Negroes did not live, my family's Mexican shades passed as various. We did not pass "for" white; my family passed among white, as in one of those old cartoons where Clarabelle the Cow goes shopping downtown and the mercantile class of dogs does not remark her exception. As opposed to Amos and Andy, whose downtown was a parallel universe of no possible admixture. And as I easily pass in these pages between being an American and regarding America from a distance.</p><p>As opposed, also, to the famous photograph of a girl in Little Rock in the pages of Life magazine. A black girl, no older than Alice, must pass alone through the looking glass. I remember wondering what my brown would have meant to Little Rock, how my brown would have withstood Little Rock.</p><p>In the Sacramento of the 1950s, it was as though White simply hadn't had time enough to figure Brown out. It was a busy white time. Brown was like the skinny or fat kids left over after the team captains chose sides. "You take the rest"-my cue to wander away to the sidelines, to wander away.</p><p>In those years, I recall seeing a movie called <i>The Defiant Ones</i>. Two convicts-Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis-were shackled to each other. The movie did not occur to me racially or politically but erotically. The child's obvious question concerned privacy. By comparison, the pairing of the Lone Ranger and Tonto on television did occur to me racially. They were twin scourges, upholders of the law of the West. They were of compatible mind and they were of complementary skill-one sneaky, one full-charge. I noticed Tonto had no vocabulary but gravitas. Of more immediate interest to me was that each wore the symbol of his reserved emotion-the mask; the hair in a bun. I didn't identify with Tonto any more than with Lone, or less. I identified with their pairing.</p><p>My parents had come from Mexico, a short road in my imagination. I felt myself as coming from a caramelized planet, an upside-down planet, pineapple-cratered. Though I was born here, I came from the other side of the looking glass, as did Alice, though not alone like Alice. Downtown I saw lots of brown people. Old men on benches. Winks from Filipinos. Sikhs who worked in the fields were the most mysterious brown men, their heads wrapped in turbans. They were the rose men. They looked like roses. And the Palestinian communist bookie-entirely hearsay-who ran a tobacco store of pungent brownness (the smell of rum-soaked cigars and cheap, cherry-scented pipe tobacco) was himself as brown as a rolled cigar, but the more mysterious for having been born in Bethlehem.</p><p>And as we passed, we passed very close to the young man, close enough for me to smell him, something anointing his hair. He was the most beautiful man (my first consciousness of the necessity for oxymoron) I remember seeing as a boy. He wore a suit-vest over his naked torso. He wore a woman's gold locket, with a dark red stone. He was petting a dog in the street. His pant knees were dirty. He smelled of coconut. He smiled brilliantly as we passed.</p><p>The missing tooth.</p><p>Heepsie, my mother whispered, taking me firmly by the hand, refusing his blazing notice with an averted nod.</p><p>I had seen the gypsy's mother-she must be his mother-dozens of times, sitting on a lawn chair outside her "office" on H Street, near my father's work. There was a sign in the window beneath which she sat, a blank hand outlined in neon. She never sought or met my gaze. She looked Mexican to me. Not Mexican, my parents assured me. My brother said, Watch out, Ricky, she's sitting there reading your tombstone.</p><p>A boy with a face as dark as mine, but several years older, stepped out of the crowd at the state fair to press a warm dime into my hand. Said nothing; wanted nothing, apparently; disappeared. His curious solemnity. But I interpreted-because I remember-the transaction as one of brown eyes.</p><p>A friend of mine, born and raised in Hong Kong, remembers attending British schools in Hong Kong; remembers being constrained to learn about India. My friend learned nothing about China; instead, the Gita and Only connect, Lord Curzon, Mother Ganga, mulligatawny, Mahatma Gandhi. The British obsession with India-as its existential opposite-seemed to my friend an affront to China. But surely there was also a kind of freedom in growing up without the Briton's attention?</p><p>My uncle from India was several times called "nigger" by strangers downtown in Sacramento. His daughter, Delia, forbade the rhyme I learned at school. Eenie, meenie, mynie, moe. . . . But her eyes softened as she corrected me and her mouth softened.</p><p>Brown is a bit of a cave in my memory. Like Delia's eyes.</p><p>Lights up, then, on "Theme from a Summer Place," on blue and gold and electric guitar strings. A decade on. I am staying for a month of summer in Laguna Beach with the family of my best friend, Larry Faherty. I am covered with a cool film of Sea &amp; Ski, as is Larry, though I suspect the insistence on this precaution by Larry's mother is gratuitous in my case. Larry's mother is sitting on the deck with a neighbor, a red-faced woman with protuberant pale blue eyes, penciled eyebrows. The bug-eyed woman burbles into her tomato juice cocktail, "some niggers . . ." (ah, ah, ah, I can feel the hairs lift on the back of my neck) ". . . some niggers came onto the beach over the weekend . . ." (she glances at me while she is saying this; her eyes are needles; I am the camel) ". . . we let them know they weren't welcome." It is not clear where I fit into her use of the first-person plural. Finally, however, my presence does not disturb her narrative.</p><p>Years later, the same story, a different summer-Columbia, South Carolina. A different storyteller-a lawyer in New York rehearses his famous anecdote, "The Hawaiian Stranger," in three passages; two tumblers of scotch.</p><p>1. It is summer, 1944; World War II is coming to an end. (There is no tragic coast to this story; the boys in it will not taste the tin can of death.) The lawyer's mother, gallantly streaming, has decided to invite a bevy of "boys so far from home" from a nearby army base onto her lawn for a Fourth of July picnic. Of course a complement of young ladies has been invited as well, Sallys and Dorothys, women from town and from the college.</p><p>2. The day dawns golden. Syrup and mosquitoes. The hired help arrive first, disinterested capable hands. By and by, the young men arrive. Smiles, sweat rings, aftershave. The young women arrive also, in summer dresses. There will be games to put the gentlemen at ease. The women arrange themselves in wicker chairs, sip cool drinks and appraise the gentlemen from the shade of the porch.</p><p>Volleyball.</p><p>But, "South Carolina in summer . . . ," the lawyer sighs, five decades later, rattling the ice in his glass.</p><p>3. Scotch #2. Conspicuous among the young recruits is a tall brown man with short-cropped hair. The Hawaiian. "Poor Mama. 'Another Coca-Cola, Mr. Cooke?' (She could just about manage that one.) But, during the volleyball game, Mr. Cooke sheds first his shirt, then his T-shirt." The narrator remembers the sight of brown shoulders, brown nipples, a navel that tempted vertigo-"Why do we remember such things, and not who invented the cotton gin?"-and the sweat streaming down Mr. Cooke's rib cage; his flared nostrils.</p><p>(Poor Mama.)</p><p>Poor Narrator. Nevertheless, Mama keeps her stride, marching her fruit-bobbling sandals into the house and back out to the yard. More potato salad? Key lime pie. Lemonade. "Each time she'd pass me-I was sitting alone under the shade tree-she'd detour; she'd come around the trunk of the tree, bend down so close I could smell her powder-she pretended to be fixing my collar or working on my cowlick-but her whisper came down furious as a flyswatter: 'He isn't either a nigger, you mind yourself, he's Hawaiian.'"</p><p>Stories darken with time, some of them.</p>***<p>The first book by an African American I read was Carl T. Rowan's memoir, <i>Go South to Sorrow</i>. I found it on the bookshelf at the back of my fifth-grade classroom, an adult book. I can remember the quality of the morning on which I read. It was a sunlit morning in January, a Saturday morning, cold, high, empty. I sat in a rectangle of sunlight, near the grate of the floor heater in the yellow bedroom. And as I read, I became aware of warmth and comfort and optimism. I was made aware of my comfort by the knowledge that others were not, are not, comforted. Carl Rowan at my age was not comforted. The sensation was pleasurable.</p><p>Only a few weeks ago, in the year in which I write, Carl T. Rowan died. Hearing the news, I felt the sadness one feels when a writer dies, a writer one claims as one's own-as potent a sense of implication as for the loss of a body one has known. Over the years, I had seen Rowan on TV. He was not, of course he was not, the young man who had been with me by the heater-the photograph on the book jacket, the voice that spoke through my eyes. The muscles of my body must form the words and the chemicals of my comprehension must form the words, the windows, the doors, the Saturdays, the turning pages of another life, a life simultaneous with mine.</p><p>It is a kind of possession, reading. Willing the Other to abide in your present. His voice, mixed with sunlight, mixed with Saturday, mixed with my going to bed and then getting up, with the pattern and texture of the blanket, with the envelope from a telephone bill I used as a bookmark. With going to Mass. With going to the toilet. With my mother in the kitchen, with whatever happened that day and the next; with clouds forming over the Central Valley, with the flannel shirt I wore, with what I liked for dinner, with what was playing at the Alhambra Theater. I remember Carl T. Rowan, in other words, as myself, as I was. Perhaps that is what one mourns.</p>***<p>In the Clunie Public Library in Sacramento, in those last years of a legally segregated America, there was no segregated shelf for Negro writers. Frederick Douglass on the same casement with Alexis de Tocqueville, Benjamin Franklin. Today, when our habit is willfully to confuse literature with sociology, with sorting, with trading in skins, we imagine the point of a "life" is to address some sort of numerical average, common obstacle or persecution. Here is a book "about" teenaged Chinese-American girls. So it is shelved.</p><p>I found this advice, the other day, in an essay by Joseph Addison, his first essay for the Spectator, the London journal, Thursday, March 1, 1711. "I have observed, that a reader seldom puruses a Book with Pleasure, 'til he knows the writer of it be a black or a fair Man, of a mild or cholerick Di...</p></p><h2>Bible Code Bombshell</h2><p><p>When Ed Sherman, a mathematician with 30 years of experience, and Nathan Jacobi, an Israeli physicist, set out to debunk claims that there were mysterious codes in the Hebrew Old Testament, they could not have envisioned the startling conclusions they would reach. As Dr. Jacobi, an agnostic Jew, looked for lengthy Hebrew codes about Christ, repeatedly he discovered compelling excerpts from the life of the man from Nazareth.</p> <p>Time and again, Dr. Jacobi found that one- or two-word codes were actually part of much longer encoded sentences that echoed the Gospel accounts. Moreover, these encoded sentences were extensively embedded in two passages most widely regarded as prophecies of the crucifixion of Christ (Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22).</p> <p>Bible Code Bombshell sets forth startling new evidence that code sequences in Scripture are irrefutable evidence of a Divine hand. In this highly readable book, Sherman offers both skeptics and believers a gold mine of information that will prompt much thinking about the origins of the Bible.</p> <ul><li>Unlike other Bible code books, this unique book features codes that are phrases and sentences, and not just one- or two-word codes</li><li>The only code book by researchers that are internationally recognized mathematicians and statistical experts</li><li>Responds directly and accurately to Bible code critics</li></ul></p><p>R.

Trump it is best to start in his natural habitat: Palm Beach, Florida. It is here he learned the techniques that took him all the way to the White House. Painstakingly, over decades, he has created a world in this exclusive tropical enclave and favorite haunt of billionaires where he is not just president but a king. The vehicle for his triumph is Mar-A-Lago, one of the greatest mansions ever built in the United States. The inside story of how he became King of Palm Beach&#x2015;and how Palm Beach continues to be his spiritual home even as president&#x2015;is rollicking, troubling, and told with unrivaled access and understanding by Laurence Leamer.</p><p>In <i>Mar-A-Lago</i>, the reader will learn:</p><p>* How Donald Trump bought a property now valued by some at as much as $500,000,000 for less than three thousand dollars of his own money.</p><p>* Why Trump was blackballed by the WASP grandees of the island and how he got his revenge.</p><p>* How Trump joined forces with the <i>National Enquirer</i>, which was headquartered nearby, and engineered his own divorce.</p><p>* How by turning Mar-A-Lago into a private club, Trump was the unlikely man to integrate Palm Beach&#x2019;s restricted country club scene, and what his real motives were.</p><p>* What transpires behind the gates of today&#x2019;s Mar-A-Lago during &#x201c;the season,&#x201d; when President Trump and assorted D.C. power players fly down each weekend.</p><p>In addition to copious interviews and reporting from inside Mar-A-Lago, Laurence Leamer brings an acute and unparalleled understanding of the society of Palm Beach, where he has lived for twenty-five years. He has written an essential book for understanding Donald Trump&#x2019;s inner character.</p></p><p><b>Laurence Leamer</b> has taught in a mountain school in Nepal in the Peace Corps, as well as worked in a factory in France and a coal mine in West Virginia. He has also written more than a dozen books, including several <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers and an off-Broadway play.

But this horrible human was not grown in a test tube.&#x201d; - <i>Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump&#x2019;s Presidential Palace</i> is a Palm Beacher&#x2019;s sophisticated take on Trump in paradise...Leamer shows how Trump tarnishes everything and everyone he touches.

In order to save Mar-a-Lago, he took on Palm Beach, went to war with the <i>National Enquirer</i>, and race-baited. It was the fight of his life, according to the author of <i>Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump&#x2019;s Presidential Palace</i>, and it may have informed everything that came after.&#x201d; - <i>Vanity Fair</i></p></p><h2>November: A Play</h2><p>David Mamet's new Oval Office satire depicts one day in the life of a beleaguered American commander-in-chief. It's November in a Presidential election year, and incumbent Charles Smith's chances for reelection are looking grim. Approval ratings are down, his money's running out, and nuclear war might be imminent. Though his staff has thrown in the towel and his wife has begun to prepare for her post-White House life, Chuck isn't ready to give up just yet. Amidst the biggest fight of his political career, the President has to find time to pardon a couple of turkeys &#x2014; saving them from the slaughter before Thanksgiving &#x2014; and this simple PR event inspires Smith to risk it all in attempt to win back public support.

This revised edition of Reading Old English aims to equip readers (advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and autodidacts) with the necessary tools to read the oldest recorded forms of the English language by explaining key language features clearly and methodically, without simplifying any of the core grammatical concepts. It includes a number of helpful exercises, a variety of interesting and unusual Old English texts to translate, as well as appendices covering the basics of traditional grammar and sound changes in Old English, along with an introduction to poetic structure.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Robert Hasenfratz&nbsp; is Professor of Medieval Studies, University of Connecticut and editor of Ancrene Wisse. Thomas J. Jambeck is Professor of Medieval Studies, University of Connecticut and author of Grammar and the Strategies of Writing.</p><p>&#x201c;By focusing on the main goal of learning to translate Old English texts, students gain access to this fascinating body of literature much more quickly. Their confidence is bolstered and many of them go on to learn more about the language and culture once they have mastered the basics.

Design combines "need" and "desire" in the form of a practical object that can also reflect the user's identity and aspirations through its form and decoration. This concise guide to contemporary design goes beyond style and taste to look at how different cultures and individuals personalize objects. Heskett also reveals how simple objects, such as a toothpick, can have their design modified to suit the specific cultural behavior in different countries. There are also fascinating insights into how major companies such as Nokia, Ford, and Sony approach design. Finally, Heskett gives us an exciting vision of what design can offer us in the future, showing in particular how it can humanize new technology.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Heskett</strong> is Chair Professior in the SChool of Design at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.<br>`Review from previous edition 'Erudite and well-researched...should be essential reading for students, educationalists, practising designers, industrialists and government.''<br>Terence Conran</p><h2>Frameworks of World History: Networks, Hierarchies, Culture, Volume Two: Since 1350</h2><p><em>Frameworks of World History</em> is a groundbreaking text that uses a clear and consistent analytical approach to studying world history. Author Stephen Morillo--an award-winning teacher with more than twenty-five years of experience teaching World History--frames the study of this vast subject around a model that shows students how to do world history and not just learn about it. While this globally organized text contains all of the essential information, it is the only book that does not just tell what happened, but also shows how and why it happened. Using a framework that examines networks, hierarchies, and culture in world history, Morillo presents a thesis and an argument that students--and instructors--can respond to.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Morillo </strong>holds the Jane and Frederic M. Hadley Chair of History at Wabash College. He is the author of numerous monographs and journal articles and the coauthor of <em>War in World History: Society, Technology and War from Ancient Times to the Present</em> (2008) and <em>Cultural Encounters: Themes and</em> <em>Sources in World History</em> (2005).<br><br>"<em>Frameworks</em> provides a coherent and consistently argued frame for understanding world history on a large and connected scale, with clear conceptual attention paid to the relationship between the global and the local. The graphic representations of the relationship between networks, hierarchies, systems, and cultural frames are innovative and facilitate learning. The text provides students with a conceptual framework and scaffold whereby students will remember and understand the larger historical contexts of world history. At the same time, it provides students with the opportunity to further their historical thinking skills by challenging and substantiating the argument made in the text."--Tim Keirn, <em>California State University, Long Beach</em> <br><p></p><br>"No other text that I am aware of challenges students to think about the course of world history in terms of cultural frames, hierarchies and networks. The strength of the approach becomes clear as the book progresses. The importance of major shifts in social organization comes more clearly into focus using this method, because students are able to use a shared framework for comparison."--Eric Nelson, <em>Missouri State University</em> <br><p></p><br>"I am struck most by the innovative model and organization that drive <em>Frameworks</em>. Far too often, 'new' world history textbooks deliver mere tweaks to a distressingly standard macro-narrative and fail to devise a method to explain world history. Morillo offers a profound rethinking of an integrated interpretation of human societies. The book's greatest strength is in the development and application of hierarchies and networks as the foundational models for analysis."--Ras Michael Brown, <em>Southern Illinois University, Carbondale</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Frameworks</em> is impressive. The author's dedication to involve a global approach in every single chapter of the book is humbling--I honestly did not think that this could be done! I also appreciate the focus on historical methodology, rather than just information. This book shows a different approach-military history, social history, religious history-in every chapter. I love that it is truly interdisciplinary and that each chapter is global in scope."--Nadejda Popov, <em>University of West Georgia</em> <br><p></p><br>"It was a privilege to read this new text. <em>Frameworks</em> is truly unique. Morillo is more than a professor or a scholar; he is a teacher-author. He not only uses a tight methodology and model for examining world civilizations, but the attendant metadiscourse (metacommentary) throughout the manuscript offers students a running lesson in historical method."--Evan Ward, <em>Brigham Young University</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>The Living Landscape, Second Edition: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning</h2><p><i>The Living Landscape</i> is a manifesto, resource, and textbook for architects, landscape architects, environmental planners, students, and others involved in creating human communities.

Through this unique perspective, the book demonstrates how micro communication acts, encounters, and relationships between and within cultural groups can influence and be influenced by macro structures, organizations, and forces - and vice versa.&nbsp;<br> <br> The book begins by introducing the concept of intercultural communication and demonstrating how ubiquitous it is in our everyday lives. Subsequent chapters address the ties between culture, power, and intercultural communication; how powerful ideologies develop from cultural views and ways of life; and the interplay of cultural representation and speaking for or about a cultural group. Readers learn the ways in which individuals and structures of power shape identity, how different structures and groups remember and forget the past, and how racialization relates to intercultural communication. The final chapters explore power dynamics with regard to globalization, intercultural relationships and desire, and our roles in intercultural communication.</p><p><strong>Rona Tamiko Halualani</strong>&nbsp;is a professor of intercultural communication at San Jos� State University.

Combining philosophical, legal and political approaches, Nickel addresses questions about what human rights are, what their content should be, and whether and how they can be justified.After outlining the contemporary conception of human rights, and developing and applying an original framework for the justification of particular rights, Nickel goes on to defend contemporary lists of human rights, covering fundamental freedoms, due process rights, social rights, and minority rights. The book also considers the issue of cultural relativism and the prospects for worldwide acceptance of human rights.Making Sense of Human Rights is suitable for use as a text in university and law school courses on human rights. The texts of key human rights documents and treaties are included as appendixes.<p><b>Making Sense of Human Rights </b><br> James W. Nickel </p><p>"This is an outstanding book.

Sensitive to the multiple hierarchies structuring social relations in modern Europe and its colonies, Timm and Sanborn offer a convincing reading of the centrality of gender to any reading of European history. A book worth reading and worth recommending. * Philippa Levine, University of Texas at Austin, USA * In their second edition of Gender, Sex and the Shaping of Modern Europe, Timm and Sanborn have produced a vigorous account of the continent&#39;s recent history that argues emphatically for the centrality of gender as a political, economic, social and cultural force. This is a detailed, lively and engaging account that has been updated with fresh scholarship and a new final chapter taking the story into the twenty-first century, including the most recent controversies between gender activists, authoritarian regimes, and religious communities. It brings the personal to the heart of the historical, and will stimulate students to think critically about gender and the past. * Dan Healey, University of Oxford, UK * Historians Timm (Univ. of Calgary) and Sanborn (Lafayette College) have updated their widely heralded 2006 study (CH, Feb&#39;08, 45-3427), incorporating almost a decade of new scholarship to include &#34;far more change than we could have ever imagined&#34; on sex and gender and how they have shaped European culture, society, and politics. This new edition expands each previous chapter to include recent work, and incorporates several important and timely issues in a new chapter titled &#34;Sex, Gender and Politics in Twenty-First-Century Europe.&#34; Included in this new chapter are analyses of topics such as sexual assault on university campuses, child and family leave for men, and online verbal abuse. The authors seamlessly weave together the history of prostitution with present-day issues of sex trafficking while enhancing their previous examinations of topics like homosexuality and the malleable nature of the family. Timm and Sanborn have masterfully revised their important work, maintaining their broad, state-specific view of the European experience and enhancing further the conversation regarding the ways in which sex and gender have operated in European society from the French Revolution to the present.

This process acquired new momentum with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, which lowered barriers to the movement of goods, capital, services, and information. But rather than include labor in this new regime, the United States continues to resist the integration of the labor markets of the two countries. Instead of easing restrictions on Mexican labor, the United States has militarized its border and adopted restrictive new policies of immigrant disenfranchisement. Beyond Smoke and Mirrors examines the devastating impact of these immigration policies on the social and economic fabric of the Mexico and the United States, and calls for a sweeping reform of the current system. Beyond Smoke and Mirrors shows how U.S. immigration policies enacted between 1986&#x2013;1996&#x2014;largely for symbolic domestic political purposes&#x2014;harm the interests of Mexico, the United States, and the people who migrate between them. The costs have been high. The book documents how the massive expansion of border enforcement has wasted billions of dollars and hundreds of lives, yet has not deterred increasing numbers of undocumented immigrants from heading north. The authors also show how the new policies unleashed a host of unintended consequences: a shift away from seasonal, circular migration toward permanent settlement; the creation of a black market for Mexican labor; the transformation of Mexican immigration from a regional phenomenon into a broad social movement touching every region of the country; and even the lowering of wages for legal U.S. residents. What had been a relatively open and benign labor process before 1986 was transformed into an exploitative underground system of labor coercion, one that lowered wages and working conditions of undocumented migrants, legal immigrants, and American citizens alike. Beyond Smoke and Mirrors offers specific proposals for repairing the damage. Rather than denying the reality of labor migration, the authors recommend regularizing it and working to manage it so as to promote economic development in Mexico, minimize costs and disruptions for the United States, and maximize benefits for all concerned. This book provides an essential "user's manual" for readers seeking a historical, theoretical, and substantive understanding of how U.S. policy on Mexican immigration evolved to its current dysfunctional state, as well as how it might be fixed.</p></p><p>DOUGLAS S.&nbsp;MASSEY is the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.

It turns out that the moment this hidden and problematic premise is discarded, quantum theory begins to "make sense" in a way that it never has before. As the author shows, it is now possible, for the first time, to integrate the findings of quantum physics into a worldview that conforms to the permanent intuitions of mankind. This work can be read by scientists but is also surprisingly accessible to the general reader unacquainted with the technical conceptions of physics or the quantum-reality literature.</p><p>Wolfgang Smith graduated from Cornell University at age eighteen with majors in physics, philosophy, and mathematics.

Lynch, University of South Florida. Quoted in Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice &#34;Michael Welch in Corrections: A Critical Approach makes some very valuable contributions to our understanding of corrections. The work hopes to offer, and I believe it does so, a critical thinking exercise that draws attention to the comparative nature of corrections, work in the field of corrections, and cultural penology. The basic premise is that we cannot accept the correctional system on its face value because the system is too crowded, too violent, and too expensive to ignore, especially if there are alternatives that are equally effective.&#34;-Dr Edward Sieh, Lasell College</p><h2>Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort</h2><p>Right-wing militias and other antigovernment organizations have received heightened public attention since the Oklahoma City bombing. While such groups are often portrayed as marginal extremists, the values they espouse have influenced mainstream politics and culture far more than most Americans realize. This important volume offers an in-depth look at the historical roots and current landscape of right-wing populism in the United States. Illuminated is the potent combination of anti-elitist rhetoric, conspiracy theories, and ethnic scapegoating that has fueled many political movements from the colonial period to the present day. The book examines the Jacksonians, the Ku Klux Klan, and a host of Cold War nationalist cliques, and relates them to the evolution of contemporary electoral campaigns of Patrick Buchanan, the militancy of the Posse Comitatus and the Christian Identity movement, and an array of millennial sects. Combining vivid description and incisive analysis, Berlet and Lyons show how large numbers of disaffected Americans have embraced right-wing populism in a misguided attempt to challenge power relationships in U.S. society.

Satisfying those wants and needs leads to the core business objective of creating value for shareholders. And that is the objective of this book: helping practitioners move from seeing IMC simply as a means of coordinating communication to viewing it as a core business strategy that is based on measurable communication inputs and outputs."</p><p>--From Chapter 1</p><p>With today's increased emphasis on technology, branding, and globalization, communication is more than just a tactical corporate activity--it becomes a key element in ongoing success.

This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> gives the reader a basic orientation to this lively literary world by focusing on texts (epics, novels, plays, poems, screenplays) that concern protagonists whose adventures and conflicts reveal shifts in literary and social practices. From the hero of the medieval <em>Song of Roland</em> to the Caribbean heroines of <em>I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem</em> or the European expatriate in Japan in <em>Fear and Trembling</em>, these problematic protagonists allow us to understand what interests writers and readers across the wide world of French literature.<br></p><p><br><strong>John D.

A fresh, bold interpretative survey, it focuses on the dynamic social forces underlying the Chinese Communists&#39; rise in three short decades from obscurity to power. The author seeks above all to relate the events of this tumultuous period to certain tentative generalizations about the nature and course of the revolution. He is concerned less with the May Fourth Movement as such, for example, than with the revolution&#39;s intellectual origins, less with the Communist party&#39;s early political history than with the place of Marxist ideology in that history, less with the military aspects of the war of 1937-45 than with the influence of nationalism in the growing success of the Communists. An important part of the book deals with the various governmental and non-governmental attempt at reform during the Kuomintang era, which the author shows were too little too late to dam the swelling flood of revolution. The conclusion evaluates the crucial role of imperialism, the peasantry, and the army in the Chinese &#34;formula&#34; for revolution and re-examines the relationship between Marxism and the Chinese Revolution.</p><p>Lucien Bianco is Directeur d&#39;Etudes at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Forest Ecosystems</h2><p><p>2009 Outstanding Academic Title, <i>Choice</i></p><p>This acclaimed textbook is the most comprehensive available in the field of forest ecology.

They are the oldest forms of life and the most prolific of all living organisms, inhabiting every part of the Earth's surface, its ocean depths, and even such inhospitable places as boiling hot springs. In this <em>Very Short Introduction,</em> bacteriologist Sebastian Amyes explores the nature of bacteria, their origin and evolution, bacteria in the environment, and bacteria and disease. Amyes discusses some of the major infections caused by bacteria-bacteria causes pneumonia, diphtheria, cholera, and many other diseases-and shows how these pathogens avoid the defences of the human body. But the book looks at all aspects of bacteria, not just the negative side, stressing the key benefits of bacteria, which have been harnessed to preserve food, dispose of waste and to provide compost for horticulture. Indeed, life for man and for many animals would be impossible without bacteria. Amyes also offers a glance into the future, describing how bacteria might be manipulated to perform tasks that they previous were unable to perform and discussing the recent construction of a completely synthetic bacterial cell.<br><br>About the Series:<br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sebastian Amyes </strong>is Professor of Microbial Chemotherapy at Edinburgh University, and author of <em>Magic Bullets: Lost Horizons.</em><br><br>"Despite its title, <em>Bacteria</em> is neither 'very short', nor is its level merely 'introductory' - it's appropriate for teachers as well as students. Succinct and full of detail, there's something for everyone to learn." --<em>The Biologist</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Virgil: Georgics: Volume 1, Books I-II (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)</h2><p>These two volumes provide a commentary, with text, on Virgil&#39;s Georgics, a poem in four books probably written between 35 and 29 BC. The introduction, in Volume 1, treats the poem&#39;s historical background and its relationship to the early years of Augustan Rome, Virgil&#39;s use of prior literary material, his stylistic and metrical expertise, and questions of poetic structure. There is also a section interpreting the poem in light of recent scholarship, which seeks to consider the poem as part of the broad unity of Virgil&#39;s career, rather than from a narrow didactic approach. A new Latin text of the poem is followed by extensive line-by-line commentary, explaining difficult passages, interpreting poetic intent, and tracing the influence of Virgil&#39;s Greek and Roman antecedents. A subject index and indexes of important Greek and Latin words conclude each volume.</p><p>Virgil&#39;s Georgics, by common consent one of the great poems of Western literature, purports to be a didactic poem on agriculture, but its true subject is man and his place in nature and society. It is also a landmark in the use of the natural world as material for literature, and in the history of man&#39;s attitude to his environment. The poem is of special interest because Virgil brings to bear his own sympathetic understanding as well as his wide reading in Greek and Latin literature. This definitive commentary by the late Sir Roger Mynors presents the poet&#39;s meaning in such away as to bring about a fuller understanding and enjoyment of the poetry, and should be an invaluable companion for all serious students of Latin literature.Publius Vergilius Maro, more famous as Virgil, was an eminent Roman poet. One of his works became the national epic of the Roman Empire. His works are still widely translated and extensively read.</p><h2>LPI Linux Certification in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (In a Nutshell (O&#39;Reilly))</h2><p><p>Linux deployment continues to increase, and so does the demand for qualified and certified Linux system administrators.

By the end of the century (and perhaps sooner), we will shift from fossil fuel dependence to rely primarily on renewable sources like solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. Driven by the need to avert catastrophic climate change and by the depletion of easily accessible oil, coal, and natural gas, this transformation will entail a major shift in how we live. What might a 100% renewable future look like? Which technologies will play a crucial role in our energy future? What challenges will we face in this transition? And how can we make sure our new system is just and equitable?<br><br> In <i>Our Renewable Future</i>, energy expert Richard Heinberg and scientist David Fridley explore the challenges and opportunities presented by the shift to renewable energy. Beginning with a comprehensive overview of our current energy system, the authors survey issues of energy supply and demand in key sectors of the economy, including electricity generation, transportation, buildings, and manufacturing. In their detailed review of each sector, the authors examine the most crucial challenges we face, from intermittency in fuel sources to energy storage and grid redesign. The book concludes with a discussion of energy and equity and a summary of key lessons and steps forward at the individual, community, and national level.<br><br> The transition to clean energy will not be a simple matter of replacing coal with wind power or oil with solar; it will require us to adapt our energy usage as dramatically as we adapt our energy sources. <i>Our Renewable Future</i> is a clear-eyed and urgent guide to this transformation that will be a crucial resource for policymakers and energy activists.</p><p>A realistic guide to the transformations required to a create a 100% renewable energy society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard Heinberg is a Senior Fellow of the Post Carbon Institute and is widely regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost educators about the need to transition away from fossil fuels.

Her approach is based on years of reflective practice but also a deep understanding of the roots of numerical difficulties and disabilities. She stresses the importance of starting with concrete and manipulable materials before moving on to more symbolic materials. Her teaching scheme building systematically on the basis of the learner&#x2032;s current understanding, rather than on mechanical measures of performance. This seems to me of fundamental importance. Overcoming Difficulties with Number provides a wealth of numerical activities and games, taking the most effective from a range of sources, including Cuisenaire rods and domino patterns for the earliest stages where learners are still counting in ones. As learners progress, clear methods for reasoning about more complex numbers are introduced. She provides very lucid methods for areas where many children, not just dyscalculics, have great difficulty, such as solving 5� x 1� or (x+1)(x+3) using grids. I highly recommend this book for teachers and teaching assistants who deal with children who have number troubles, but I also believe that most teachers of early maths will find much that is helpful with all learners&#x2032; - <b><i>Professor Brian Butterworth, University College London</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p><p></p> <p>&#x2032;I have tried some of the activities with pairs in a whole class situation and they work very well, particularly with children struggling to remember facts through traditional methods (that are not always particularly successful with many) or with younger children learning to count and memorize number facts for the first time&#x2032; - <b><i>Mike Eatwell, Deputy Headteacher, Bristol</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p><p></p> <p>&#x2032;The best part of the book for me is the range of resources in the appendices and the discussion of classroom activities.

Led by Catherine Bauer, supporters of the modern housing initiative argued that government should emphasize non-commercial development of imaginatively designed compact neighborhoods with extensive parks and social services. The book explores the question of how Americans might have responded to this option through case studies of experimental developments in Philadelphia and New York. While defeated during the 1930s, modern housing ideas suggest a variety of design and financial strategies that could contribute to solving the housing problems of our own time.<br> <br></p></p><p><b>Gail Radford</b> is&nbsp;associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo.</p><h2>Student Atlas of World Geography</h2><p>The <b>Student Atlas</b> series combines full-color maps and data sets to introduce students to the importance of the connections between geography and other areas of study such as world politics, environmental issues, and economic development.

Originality. Intelligence. Everyone in academia stresses quality. But what exactly is it, and how do professors identify it? </p><p>In the academic evaluation system known as &#x201c;peer review,&#x201d; highly respected professors pass judgment, usually confidentially, on the work of others. But only those present in the deliberative chambers know exactly what is said. Mich�le Lamont observed deliberations for fellowships and research grants, and interviewed panel members at length. In <i>How Professors Think,</i> she reveals what she discovered about this secretive, powerful, peculiar world. </p><p>Anthropologists, political scientists, literary scholars, economists, historians, and philosophers don&#x2019;t share the same standards. Economists prefer mathematical models, historians favor different kinds of evidence, and philosophers don&#x2019;t care much if only other philosophers understand them. But when they come together for peer assessment, academics are expected to explain their criteria, respect each other&#x2019;s expertise, and guard against admiring only work that resembles their own. They must decide: Is the research original and important? Brave, or glib? Timely, or merely trendy? Pro-diversity or interdisciplinary enough?</p><p>Judging quality isn&#x2019;t robotically rational; it&#x2019;s emotional, cognitive, and social, too. Yet most academics&#x2019; self-respect is rooted in their ability to analyze complexity and recognize quality, in order to come to the fairest decisions about that elusive god, &#x201c;excellence.&#x201d; In <i>How Professors Think,</i> Lamont aims to illuminate the confidential process of evaluation and to push the gatekeepers to both better understand and perform their role.</p></p><p>Mich�le Lamont is Robert I. Goldman Professor of European Studies and Professor of Sociology and African and African American Studies at Harvard University.&#x201c;This fair-minded and reader-friendly book might just help produce the trust, respect, and tolerance necessary for academic community. By closely examining scholarly evaluation and identifying distinctive disciplinary definitions of quality among the humanities and social sciences, Mich�le Lamont shows that academic culture, far from being a hierarchy declining from supposedly more "rigorous" and demanding disciplines to those less so, is constituted of many different excellencies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas Bender, author of <i>Intellect and Public Life</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A masterpiece. Lamont starts with her greatest accomplishment: a nuanced account of the epistemic cultures that dominate social sciences and humanities. Their differences show the problem of building a culture of discourse in multidisciplinary review, so that committees can decide which standard is best. Lamont breaks new ground in showing how personal preferences, disciplinary, gender, and ethnic diversity, and elitist and populist impulses are incorporated in such decisions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Arthur Stinchcombe, author of <i>The Logic of Social Research</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Professors pride themselves on objectivity, or failing that, fairness to competing views, or failing that, at least the capacity for neutral analysis. But based on her ground-breaking study of peer review, Mich�le Lamont argues that professorial pride is excessive, that the outcomes of peer review are shaped by institutional mechanics as much as by reason, and that reviewers favor work that looks like their own much more than they realize they do. But Lamont also shows that that reviewers are serious about trying to identify the best proposals and trying to overcome their own biases, and that their commitment to the review process itself makes the outcomes more fair. <i>How Professors Think</i> will be eye-opening for those who run peer review, those who participate in it, and those interested in a sociology of expert judgment.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Craig Calhoun, Social Science Research Council</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this ingenious study, the first of its kind, Mich�le Lamont opens an important and mysterious black box--how professors arrive at "fair evaluations". Lamont brilliantly shows us not only the interpersonal processes that make review panels work, but also how disciplinary cultures affect academic judgment, and what the political and knowledge consequences are of the way we judge excellence. It will be enlightening for everyone in academia.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Karin Knorr Cetina, University of Chicago and University of Konstanz</b><br><br>&#x201c;All the deans and provosts who fret about their rankings and grant money should read this first hand account of how scholars and social scientists are evaluated in practice.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bruno Latour, author of <i>Politics of Nature: How to Bring the Sciences into Democracy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Balanced, informative and largely persuasive.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Kuper</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>How Professors Think: Inside the Curious World of Academic Judgment</i> gives the reader keen insight into the decision-making process behind the awarding of prestigious fellowships.

Over two volumes, Joachim Whaley rejects the notion that this was a long period of decline, and shows instead how imperial institutions developed in response to the crises of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, notably the Reformation and Thirty Years War. The impact of international developments on the Reich is also examined.<br><br>The first volume begins with an account of the reforms of the reign of Maximilian I and concludes with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. It offers a new interpretation of the Reformation, the Peasants' War, the Schmalkaldic War and the Peace of Augsburg, and of the post-Reformation development of Protestantism and Catholicism. The German policy successfully resisted the ambitions of Charles V and the repeated onslaughtsof both the Ottomans and the French, and it remained stable in the face of the French religious wars and the Dutch Revolt. The volume concludes with an analysis of the Thirty Years War as an essentially German constitutional conflict, triggered by the problems of the Habsburg dynasty and prolonged by the interventions of foreign powers. The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the conflict, both reflected the development of the German polity since the late fifteenth century and created teh framework for its development over the next hundred and fifty years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joachim Whaley</strong> is Senior Lecturer in German, Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages, University of Cambridge.

Presenting a series of critical appreciations of English poetry from Anglo-Saxon times to the present day, Malcolm Guite applies the insights of poetry to contemporary issues and the contribution poetry can make to our religious knowing and the way we &#39;do theology&#39;. This book is not solely concerned with overtly religious poetry, but attends to the paradoxical ways in which the poetry of doubt and despair also enriches theology. Developing an original analysis and application of the poetic vision of Coleridge, Larkin and Seamus Heaney in the final chapters, Guite builds towards a substantial theology of imagination and provides unique insights into truth that complement and enrich more strictly rational ways of knowing. Readers of this book will return to their reading of poetry equipped with new insights and enthusiasm and will be challenged to integrate imaginative ways of knowing into their other academic and intellectual pursuits.</p><p>Malcolm Guite is a poet, priest and academic living and working in Cambridge. His recent writings include &#x2019;What Do Christians Believe?' 2006, 'Poetry, Playfulness and Truth...&#x2019; a chapter on the theology of A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream and The Tempest in Faithful Performances: Enacting Christian Tradition, ed. Trevor Hart and Stephen Guthrie Ashgate 2007 and six poems in Live Simply, 2008. His chapter on the poetry of CS Lewis appears in the Cambridge Companion to CS Lewis, 2010.'Malcolm Guite, in this wide-ranging and original study, helps us see how poetry is - if we let ourselves be drawn in and shaped by it - a means of making connections with the fundamental way things are, and so too a way of connecting with a God who is himself a pattern of 'connection' as Trinity, open to share the divine reality with created life. Here are materials for a profound theology of the imagination, developed in dialogue with writers both familiar and unfamiliar, beautifully combining close reading with wide horizons.' The Most Revd Dr Rowan Williams 'No one with an interest in the history of poetry inspired by the Christian Faith can fail to be impressed with this book. Malcolm Guite has offered us an immensely rich work, ranging from the 8th Century Dream of the Rood, to Seamus Heaney via Shakespeare, John Davies, John Donne and George Herbert, in which the truth-telling available only in poetry is brought into the service of mature theological vision. It is quite simply both astounding and outstanding.' The Rt Revd Professor Stephen Sykes 'Malcolm Guite has the rare gift of being able to open up the depths of poetry and theology together. He is alert to form, content and context, and above all to the nuances of poetic visions of God, the complexities of faith, and spiritual transformations.' David Ford, Regius Professor of Divinity, University of Cambridge, UK 'To enter Malcolm Guite's Faith, Hope &amp; Poetry is to discover a new continent with dazzling possibilities, a landscape where scholarship, vivid faith, word craft, imaginative insight, reflection and careful research are all available at a level that is revelatory to both academics and lay readers alike. Guite, not only an ordained Anglican priest but a poet and scholar of the highest order, invites us to this fresh feast - a summons that will widen our own worlds immeasurably.' Luci Shaw, Author, Harvesting Fog: Poems; Breath for the Bones: Art, Imagination, and Spirit 'For a lover of poetry it is a feast, for someone intrigued by poetry and theology, it is indeed a landmark work... there's something extraordinary about the freshness of his readings of such statuesque figures of the English literary tradition.' Transitions 'This book leaves the reader in no doubt as to the fruitfulness of poetry for theology. It is both a stimulating study for academic and a delightfully nourishing read for anyone with an interest in Christianity and the arts.' Theology '[Faith, Hope and Poetry] carries a compelling vision, worked out in dialogue with great poetry from across the span of English literature, of 'imaginative shaping and symbolic apprehension in the discovery of meaning and [...] truth'.' Journal of Theological Studies 'Malcolm Guite offers a welcome challenge to the division of 'two cultures' as discerned by C.P.Snow and the dissociation of 'sensibility' as identified by T.S.Eliot.' Heythrop Journal 'Faith, Hope and Poetry is an essential book for anyone hoping to work with literature as a mode of apologetics - an endeavor which is critical for evangelism in our postmodern, often post-Christian culture. The book's importance for literary apologetics is twofold. First, it is a compelling argument for the importance of Imagination in the pursuit of Truth; Guite helps us see clearly and deeply how poetry allows us to know truth in a different but complementary way to propositional, rational argument. Second, the specific close readings of the works provide a model for apologists of how to interact with poetry on poetry's terms, and thus enter into an imaginative experience of great power... Faith, Hope and Poetry is valuable not just for its specific insights, but also for its model of how to think, feel, and respond with both heart and mind as a Christian in the modern world.' Apologetics315 'Guite's method is to take the reader through a history of English religious poetry, with the aim of showing not merely that poetry has a natural theological bias, but that this theological or devotional content actually lies at the heart of the English poetic tradition.' Times Literary Supplement 'The express aim of this packed, rich and unusual book is to show that poetic imagination is truth-bearing and that this is valuable to theology... Malcolm Guite's book is a most compelling read, to Coleridgeans, and to Christians and non-Christians alike.' Coleridge Bulletin '... [a] thoroughly exceptional book; beautiful, engaging, and filled with striking insights... Guite does not argue his case so much as he demonstrates it, through careful and skilful readings of poetry. This is a particularly striking and attractive virtue of this lovely book... Faith, Hope and Poetry incarnates the best sort of theological engagement with the arts, one in which both theology and art are valued and given full play.' Image: Art, Faith, Mystery '... a delightful tour through some wonderful poetry. His book is both a challenge and an invitation, a delight and a dare.' Weblog 'A Wineskin in the Smoke' '... provide[s] some interesting material for reflection on the role of theological treatments of literary texts and the status of secularity such a theological discourse implies.' Literature and Theology 'Apart from personal reading (which I highly recommend), I can see a strong use for Faith, Hope and Poetry as a teaching resource... I could happily build a "theology and poetry" course around the entire text, confining myself pretty much to the poetry readings therein... Working patiently through these selections in seminar fashion with alert students would be a dream.' Christianity &amp; Literature 'Faith, Hope and Poetry is an enjoyable book, laudably readable and accessible, and full of material for further reflection and discussion.' Notes and Queries 'In this book Malcolm Guite offers us three gifts: a lucid explanation of the role that the poetic imagination plays in resolving the bitter debate between science and theology inherited from the Enlightenment; a perceptive study of a selection of British poems written between the tenth and the twenty-first centuries that illustrate how the imagination offers 'the redress of an imbalance in our vision of the world and ourselves' (p.1); and an approach to understanding and experiencing those poems in the form of five suggestions for reading poetry deeply and perceptively.' Temenos Academy Review '...Guite's Faith,Hope and Poetry: Theology and the Poetic Imagination should be read as not merely a delightful glimpse into a particular strain of poetry, but also as a clarion call for all Christian theologians to reclaim an essential way of knowing Christian truth.'

Bradley's mother worked part time, and his father worked full&#x2013;time in a small business. With both parents working, the family was lucky to have support from their maternal grandmother, who provided a significant amount of caregiving while Bradley's mother was working.</p><p>Bradley spoke in single words and short phrases to have his needs met. He also engaged in disruptive behaviors (e.g., screaming, tantrums, grabbing) when he was told "no" or when making the transition from a preferred activity (e.g., playing video games) to a nonpreferred activity (e.g., getting ready for school). In the area of play, he showed some interest in several toys, but his play often became repetitive (e.g., saying the same words after pushing a button, repeatedly landing on the same square of a board game). Socially, he showed some interest in other children, but he did not interact or play appropriately with them.</p><p>These behaviors prompted Bradley's mother to contact the Autism Research and Training center (ARTC) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to participate in an individualized parent education program. She hoped to gain skills to increase Bradley's motivation to communicate, to reduce his aggressive and noncompliant behaviors, and to improve the family's interactions with him. Bradley's mother and babysitter participated in the program. During the week&#x2013;long, intensive program, Bradley's mother learned techniques to address his motivation and to improve his social communication. She mastered the use of the motivational teaching techniques and identified teaching opportunities that could be transferred to the family's typical routines (e.g., meals, bath time, play time) at home and in the community. Most important, she became hopeful that her son would make progress in his communication skills and was eager to share her new experience and skills with others who interacted frequently with Bradley (e.g., Bradley's grandmother, teachers, and therapists).</p><p>When the family returned home, Bradley's mother successfully taught his father how to use the Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) strategies with Bradley during play interactions. When the family visited with Bradley's grandparents shortly thereafter, Bradley's grandmother commented on the improvements in his language as well. The family has maintained a relationship with the parent educator through email and telephone contact. Three years after the family participated in the program, Bradley's mother still shares Bradley's progress through anecdotal stories about his academic and social success as a student in an inclusive elementary school classroom: Just wanted to say "Hi" and brag about my son. . . . He has a wonderful teacher and incredible "first grade friends". . . . [Bradley] is included full time &#x2014; he doesn't even leave for special ed. He receives all his instruction in the regular class and is performing at or above grade level in all areas. His teacher tells me there are days at recess you would never know he has special needs. . . . [During a school game] he shouted, "I'm a winner!" and EVERY kid in that class cheered for him. They were all truly excited for him. It was one of those moments I just wanted to cry.</p><p><b>OVERVIEW OF THE PARENT EDUCATION PROGRAM</b></p><p>Although the majority of services at the ARTC are provided to nearby families, ARTC's parent education program provides services to children with autism and their families who live far from the center. With the growing number of children becoming diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and a limited number of specialized centers, more families are searching for services for their children (Bryson, Clark, &amp; Smith, 1998; Burton, 2002; Fombonne, 2003b; Gillberg, Steffenburg, &amp; Schaufman, 1991; R.L. Koegel, Koegel, &amp; Carter, 1999; Yeargin&#x2013;Allsopp, Rice, &amp; Karapurkar, 2003). ARTC's parent education program provides an innovative service delivery system that expands existing resources and gives children and families access to specialized services. This chapter describes the program and describes a project that provided some initial findings through qualitative outcome data. The goal of this project was to begin to understand the types of support and experiences that families encountered as a result of participating in a parent education program. Although the findings are specific to ARTC's program, the experiences that participating families have are likely similar to those of many other families who receive parent education as part of their child's intervention plan. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss an intensive parent education program and the effect it can have on the families of children with autism.</p><p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p><p>A body of literature discusses the challenges that many parents face if their child is diagnosed with a disability such as autism. Parents of children with disabilities can endure high levels of negative stress, often reported to be in the clinical range as scored on standardized measures. This heightened stress can be due to the unknown prognosis for the child's future and the family's challenged expectations. It can also be related to obtaining high-quality specialized resources that the children often need. Children with ASDs require special education resources, as well as ongoing and intensive intervention and support. In regard to obtaining effective and appropriate support, researchers have identified common barriers that family members face (Ruef, Turnbull, Turnbull, &amp; Poston, 1999; Turnbull &amp; Ruef, 1996). Through focus group meetings, these authors obtained feedback from individuals with disabilities, their family members, and others who support them. They found that a lack of effective resources was a widespread barrier to effectively supporting families. This lack of resources was associated with a limited amount of services, lack of sufficiently trained staff members, high staff turnover, negative staff attitudes, and use of negative practices. Again, realizing the discrepancy between the specialized services available to families of children with autism as compared with the growing number of identified children, it is clear why families may struggle to find support for their children and themselves. In order to obtain these necessary services for their children, parents may be faced with excessive financial burdens and stress (Birenbaum &amp; Cohen, 1993; Singer &amp; Powers, 1993a).</p><p>In addition to the emotional and financial stress of trying to obtain appropriate services, parents of children with autism often deal with the stress caused from managing their children's challenging behaviors. In children who have a diagnosis of autism, social communication is delayed and stereotypic behaviors are common. Many of these children rely on using early forms of communication, specifically disruptive behaviors, to get their needs met. They also engage in repetitive and stereotypic behaviors that also present challenges to parents who find it strenuous to successfully interact with their children in more prosocial ways. Research has shown elevated levels of stress for parents of children with autism due to the children's scattered skills and engagement in repetitive and antisocial behavior (Moes, 1995; Plienis, Robbins, &amp; Dunlap, 1988). Parents of children with autism reported greater stress related to caregiving responsibilities, cognitive impairment, disruption in daily activities, and long&#x2013;term care for their children as compared with parents whose children did not have disabilities. Specifically, findings suggest that parenting a child with a disability increases stress in the areas of everyday management of disruptive behaviors, heavy caregiving responsibilities, and concerns about the child's future when the parents are no longer able to care for the child (R.L. Koegel, Koegel, &amp; Schreibman, 1991). Heavy caregiving responsibilities and problem behaviors can affect the family's daily living situation by limiting engagement in leisure or recreational activities. For example, if a child has tantrums in public areas (e.g., a restaurant, the grocery store), the family may avoid taking their child into the community.</p><p>For these reasons, families can develop feelings of social isolation and choose not to engage in such activities. For a family that enjoys spending time in community settings, having a child who engages in disruptive and stereotypic behaviors can be embarrassing, stressful, and overwhelming. This lifestyle alteration can serve as a source of stress for families. In turn, these areas of family stress can inevitably lead to a lowered quality of life for the children and for their family members. The increased stress for parents of children with autism was found to be consistent across family characteristics including geographic location, child's age, and severity of impairment (R.L. Koegel, Koegel, &amp; Surratt, 1992).</p><p>In an effort to enhance program outcomes and to support families, many intervention programs for children with autism include a parent education component. Given that children with autism typically spend time engaged in self&#x2013;stimulatory or other socially avoidant behaviors, they miss many natural opportunities to learn from their environment. Therefore, it has been suggested that they receive intensive intervention throughout the day and during their waking hours (L.K. Koegel, Koegel, Kellegrew, &amp; Mullen, 1996; Lovaas, 1987). There is a large body of literature supporting the inclusion of parents as active team members for their children with autism, and the results of many studies have shown the benefits of this model. Unlike professionals, teachers, and service providers, parents typically spend more time with their children throughout the days and evenings or on weekends. Therefore, they can provide "round&#x2013;the&#x2013;clock" intervention for their children (R.L. Koegel, Koegel, Frea, &amp; Smith, 1995). Educators and other service providers most likely provide support to children based on a set weekday schedule, during specific and regular periods of time, and in a particular setting such as a clinic room, classroom, or even in a room at the child's home. Conversely, parents are natural teachers for their children throughout the week and on the weekend. They are often with their children in numerous settings such as homes, stores, restaurants, airports, parks, beaches, museums, and movie theatres. In addition to the various settings in which parents are frequently with their children, parents also provide teaching opportunities across various daily routines such as mealtime, car rides, bath time, running errands, shopping, and bedtime. Therefore, a benefit of parent education is the likelihood that children's skills will more likely generalize because teaching occurs in many settings.</p></p><h2>The Handbook of Japanese Verbs (Kodansha Dictionary)</h2><p>From the very earliest stages of study until far into the intermediate level, students of the Japanese language are continually scratching their heads over the usage of verbs. It is no wonder that they should feel the need for a solid reference book, one they can continually turn to throughout their studying careers. <i>The Handbook of Japanese Verbs</i> is just that book.<br>The Introduction takes the first step toward comprehension by pointing out the features of Japanese verbs that stand in contrast to their English counterparts, such as tense, politeness level, auxiliaries, and transitive and intransitive forms.<br>Part 1 shows through tables and concise commentary how Japanese verbs are categorized, conjugated, and combined with auxiliaries. Each form is followed by a short exercise, reinforcing the points just made.<br>Part 2 takes up the forms described in the first part and shows how they function in full-fledged sentences. Each discussion is followed by examples and exercises, ensuring that the student has understood the forms under discussion.<br>In the appendices, the student is offered a number of look-up methods, including an English-Japanese verb dictionary. This completes the apparatus necessary for a solid handbook on Japanese verbs, a book students can rely on for many years to come</p><p><b>TAEKO KAMIYA</b> received a BA for Doshisha Women's College (Kyoto) and MAs from the University of San Francisco in education and from the Monterey Institute of International Studies in linguistics. She taught Japanese for twenty-five years at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. Among her publications are Speak Japanese Today (1989), Japanese for Fun: Make Your Stay in Japan More Enjoyable (1990), Tuttle New Dictionary on Loanwords in Japanese (1994), Subject-Grouped 1016 Kanji in Context (1997), and Japanese Particle Workbook (1998).Preface <p>In order to master a foreign language, it is crucial for students to acquire a solid knowledge of its verbs and their usage. Japanese is no exception. </p><p>Japanese verbs are often said to be difficult and complicated and hard to learn. That is not true. In fact, they are simple and less complicated to learn than those of many other languages. Unlike some European languages, you do not have to memorize different forms to indicate the number or person or gender of the subject of the sentence. The verb kaku, for instance, could mean I/we write, you (sing./ pl.) write, he/she/it writes or they write. Moreover, Japanese verbs are highly regular in the way they make their forms. Once you grasp certain rules for making such forms as the negative, conjunctive, conditional forms, etc., you will be able to apply these rules to almost any verbs. </p><p>The purpose of this book is to describe in detail not only how Japanese verbs conjugate, but how you should use the verb forms in connection with sentence structures. </p><p>The book is divided into two parts. Part I deals with the conjugations of the three types of verbs--regular I, regular II and irregular verbs, as well as copulas (be-verbs) and auxiliaries. A conjugation practice follows the description of a verb or a group of verbs. Part II deals with the usage of various verb forms. Each usage is illustrated with example sentences, and exercises are provided every few lessons to allow you to test your understanding. </p><p>I do hope that this book will prove to be helpful--you will discover how simple and easy conjugating and using Japanese verbs can be.</p></p><h2>The Cultural Complex: Contemporary Jungian Perspectives on Psyche and Society</h2><p>How do cultural complexes affect the collective psyche? <br><br>Based on Jung's theory of complexes, this book offers a new perspective on the psychological nature of conflicts between groups and cultures by introducing the&nbsp;concept of the cultural complex. This modern version of Jung's idea offers an original view of the forces that prevent human attempts to bring a peaceful, collaborative spirit to conflict between groups. <br><br>Leading analysts and academics from a range of cultural backgrounds present their own perspective on the concept, demonstrating how the effects of cultural complexes can be felt in the behaviour of disenfranchised, oppressed and traumatised groups across the world. Ultimately, a clearer understanding of the source and nature of group conflict is reached through discussion of central subjects including: <br><br>* Collective trauma and cultural complexes<br>* Exploring racism: a clinical example of a cultural complex<br>* Cultural complexes in the history of Jung, Freud and their followers. <br><br><em>The Cultural Complex </em>represents a valuable contribution to analytical psychology and will undoubtedly also stimulate dialogue in the fields of sociology, political science and cultural studies.</p><p></p><h2>The Mediated World: A New Approach to Mass Communication and Culture</h2><p>Today&#x2019;s students have a world of knowledge at their fingertips, and no longer need textbooks filled with names and dates crammed into a single volume. The Mediated World takes as its starting point the understanding that readers want a compelling story, a good read, an intelligent analysis, and a new way of looking at the media revolutions around us. It is designed as a life line to help students understand and interpret the sea of media washing over us all. <br><br>In this text, David Mindich writes for students who want to understand how we communicate to one another, how we process our world, and how the media shapes us. His engaging and narrative style focuses on concepts and real-world contexts--he avoids a dry recitation of facts--that helps students understand their own personal relationship with media and gives them the tools to push back against the media forces. <br><br>One of the primary goals of The Mediated World is to empower readers by giving them a thorough understanding of the media; and by teaching them how to counter the force of the media and at the same time use this force for their own ends.

In this book, Richard F. Hirsh explains how and why this radical restructuring has occurred. Hirsh starts by describing the successful campaign waged by utility managers in the first decade of the twentieth century to protect their industry from competition. The regulated system that emerged had the unanticipated consequence of endowing utility managers with great political and economic power. Seven decades later, a series of largely unanticipated events, including technological stagnation in traditional generating equipment, the 1973 energy crisis, and the rise of the environmental movement, undermined the managers' control of the system. New players, such as academics, environmental advocates, politicians, and potential competitors, wrested control from power company managers by challenging utilities' standing as "natural monopolies" and by questioning whether their firms provided universal benefits. In other words, the once-closed system came under increasing pressure to transform itself. Hirsh follows the flow of power as this transformation occurred. He also examines the relationship between technological change and regulation, showing how innovations such as cogeneration and renewable energy technologies stimulated questions about the value of government oversight of the system. And he shows how the increasing prominence of ideas such as conservation, energy efficiency, and free markets helped propel the system toward open competition. Though the new electric utility system is still in its infancy, Hirsh's perceptive account of its birth will help readers think more rationally about its future.</p></p><p>Richard F. Hirsh is Professor of History and of Science and Technology Studies at Virginia Tech.<p>Insightful, thoughtful, and understandable,<i> Power Loss</i> explores the origins of the changes with a historical perspective. A must-read for anyone trying to understand what is happening to the American electric utility industry. The principles and framework of technological and social systems used by the author reveal that the story of this industry has broader implications than just to the making of electricity.

In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.</p></p><p>Michael Tomasello is Codirector of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig. He is the author of <i>The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition</i> and <i>Constructing a Language: A Usage-Based Theory of Language Acquisition.</i>&#34;Underscoring the uniqueness of humans is all too easy. The challenge is to explain it in a naturalistic perspective. Michael Tomasello meets the challenge with his unique suite of competencies in animal and human psychology, and his ability to think and write with clarity and insight about complex issues. There is much to learn and much to think and also to argue about in this important book.&#34;--Dan Sperber, Institut Jean Nicod</p><h2>The Mongols</h2><p>The revised second edition of this highly praised introduction to the Mongol Empire takes account of recent scholarship in the field.<br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Provides an overview of the government, religion, and politics of the Mongolian Empire<br> </li> <li>Considers the effects of Mongol military campaigns on other countries and peoples in China, Russia, Persia and Europe<br> </li> <li>Assesses the astonishing military career of Chingiz (Genghis) Khan<br> </li> <li>Now includes a new epilogue assessing the contribution of recent scholarship to our understanding of the Mongols&#x2019; history<br> </li> <li>Well-illustrated by maps and photographs throughout</li> </ul></p><p>The Mongol Empire was the largest continuous land empire known to history, its violent creation the major political event of the thirteenth century world.

Through it the reader will be able to trace the origin, the diffusion and the many layers of meaning of a central element of Christianity for a period of well over a millennium. We begin with the martyrs, with vivid tales of public cruelty in the cities of the Greco-Roman Mediterranean and with holy men and women in a recognizably Roman world in its last days. We end, often with the same figures, transformed over time, so as to become part of the Christian 'folklore' of all Western Europe. Gathered from the vernacular languages of Europe, as well as from Latin texts, this collection does justice to the many layers to which the cult of the saints penetrated, and to the constantly changing views of the human person implied in the idea of Christian sanctity.

It now includes "big picture" questions to highlight central themes in morphology as well as research exercises for each chapter.<br> Understanding Morphology presents an introduction to the study of word structure that starts at the very beginning. Assuming no knowledge of the field of morphology on the part of the reader, the book presents a broad range of morphological phenomena from a wide variety of languages. Starting with the core areas of inflection and derivation, the book presents the interfaces between morphology and syntax and between morphology and phonology. The synchronic study of word structure is covered as are the phenomena of diachronic change such as analogy and grammaticalization.<br> Theories are presented clearly in accessible language with the main purpose of shedding light on the data, rather than as a goal in themselves. The authors consistently draw on the best research available, thus utilizing and discussing both functionalist and generative theoretical approaches.<br> Each chapter includes a summary, suggestions for further reading, and exercises.

The distinctive cell biology of the fungi is linked to their development as well as their metabolism and physiology. One of the great advances in mycology in recent decades is the recognition of the vital importance of fungi in the natural environment. Plants are supported by mycorrhizal symbioses with fungi, are attacked by other fungi that cause plant diseases, and are the major decomposers of their dead tissues.

In <em>The African Imagination in Music</em>, renowned music scholar Kofi Agawu offers an introduction to the major dimensions of this music and the values upon which it rests. Agawu leads his readers through an exploration of the traditions, structural elements, instruments, and performative techniques that characterize the music. In sections that focus upon rhythm, melody, form, and harmony, the essential parts of African music come into relief. While traditional music, the backbone of Africa's musical thinking, receives the most attention, Agawu also supplies insights into popular and art music in order to demonstrate the breadth of the African musical imagination. Close readings of a variety of songs, including an Ewe dirge, an Aka children's song, and Fela's 'Suffering and Smiling' supplement the broader discussion. <br><em>The African Imagination in Music</em> foregrounds a hitherto under-reported legacy of recordings and insists on the necessity of experiencing music as sound in order to appreciate and understand it fully. Accordingly, a Companion Website features important examples of the music discussed in detail in the book. Accessibly and engagingly written for a general audience, <em>The African Imagination in Music</em> is poised to renew interest in Black African music and to engender discussion of its creative underpinnings by Africanists, ethnomusicologists, music theorists and musicologists.<br></p><p><br>Kofi Agawu was born in Ghana, West Africa where he received his initial education before studying in the UK and the US. He has taught and lectured at numerous universities in Africa, Europe and the United States. Agawu is a wide-ranging scholar and author of numerous articles and books on musical semiotics, the analysis of music, and West African music, which include <em>Playing with Signs: A Semiotic Interpretation of Classical Music</em> (Princeton University Press, 1991), <em>African Rhythm: A Northern Ewe Perspective</em>, <em>Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions</em> (Routledge, 2003) and<em> Music as Discourse: Semiotic Adventures in Romantic Music</em> (Oxford University Press, 2008).

He continues to conduct research in these areas and is the recipient of numerous grants and contracts (over $18 million in funded projects). His latest work is concentrated in four areas: (1) quality improvement in police agencies through advanced leadership and management practices; (2) international terrorism, especially Middle-Eastern groups, and the spread of radical Islam; (3) evaluation of community policing, CompStat, and intelligence-led policing strategies in the United States; and (4) intelligence analysis, fusion centers, and decision making, particularly during protracted conflict or crisis situations.<br> <br>In 2004, the International Justice Mission in Washington, D.C., asked Dr. Taylor to assist in the training of the Cambodian National Police on child sex slavery and human trafficking as part of a large project funded through the U.S. Department of State ($1 million). His interest and research in this area have led to a leadership role in designing and developing training efforts in the United States aimed at raising awareness of the human trafficking tragedy for American law enforcement officers, funded in part through the U.S. Department of Justice. Dr. Taylor focuses on the nexus between human trafficking, drug trafficking, and the financing of terrorist incidents internationally and domestically. He continues this important work as a guest lecturer, speaking at conferences internationally on these subjects.<br> <br>In 2003, Dr. Taylor was awarded the University of North Texas, Regent&#x2019;s Lecture Award for his work in the Middle East.

He joined Florida Governor Claude Kirk&#x2019;s staff as a Senior Police Planner and later as Deputy Director of the Governor&#x2019;s Council on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. Dr. Swanson taught criminal justice courses at East Carolina University before becoming a faculty member at the Institute of Government (IOG) at the University of Georgia. Faculty members in the IOG are charged with carrying out programs of research, training, and technical assistance for Georgia units of state and local government. Dr. Swanson specialized in reorganization of police departments to achieve enhanced performance.<br> <br>For much of his 29 years in the IOG, Dr. Swanson focused on three efforts:<br> </p> <ul> <li> <i>Designing promotional systems for police and fire departments. </i>Notably, he led a large city police department and a state patrol agency out of federal court, creating promotional systems that are still used and have not been successfully challenged. Dr. Swanson has designed hundreds of valid and reliable written promotional tests and assessment center exercises. He has trained hundreds of assessors and directed more than 50 assessment centers.</li> <li> <i>Training.</i> As Director of the IOG&#x2019;s Southeastern Law Enforcement Programs, he created and led advanced training programs for more than 10,000 officers from 46 states and 4 foreign countries.</li> <li> <i>Partnering with police departments to foster improvements. </i>Virtually on a daily basis for 29 years, Dr. Swanson worked with police departments to resolve smaller to large-scale problems, often acting as a change agent. On a larger scale, he conducted analyses that were the basis of his reorganization of units or entire police agencies, as well as the consolidation of a large city police department with a county police agency. Many of Dr. Swanson&#x2019;s more than 100 technical reports were written to support his work in this area.</li> </ul> <p>Dr. Swanson advanced through the administrative ranks of the IOG, Program Director, Division Director, Deputy Director, and retired as the Acting Director. His home is in Athens, Georgia, a musical hotspot with several internationally known bands residing there. One of his more unusual consulting jobs was advising a major touring band on how to recover a member&#x2019;s stolen guitar.<br> <br>In addition to conference papers, refereed articles, and chapters in books, Dr. Swanson has coauthored several books, including <i>The Police Personnel Selection Process</i>, <i>Introduction to Criminal Justice</i>, <i>Court Administration</i>, <i>Police Administration: Structures, Processes, and Behavior</i> (9th edition, 2017), and <i>Criminal Investigation</i> (12th edition, 2018).<br> <br>Dr. Swanson has received an array of recognitions, including a Distinguished Service Award and the Walter Bernard Hill Award from the University of Georgia, commendations from the governors of three states for contributions to public service, the O.W. Wilson Award for Distinguished Scholarship, a Service Award from the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, as well as receiving their First Honorary Chief of Police Award for service to that organization. As a consultant, Dr. Swanson has worked with police agencies as far apart as the Elizabeth, New Jersey, Police Department, the Dallas Police Department, and the Multnomah County (Oregon) Department of Public Safety. He has also taught abroad in the Shanghai Municipal Institute.

In this provocative book, Robert P. Ericksen examines the work and attitudes of three distinguished, scholarly, and influential theologians who greeted the rise of Hitler with enthusiasm and support. In so doing, he shows how National Socialism could appeal to well-meaning and intelligent people in Germany and why the German university and church were so silent about the excesses and evil that confronted them. &nbsp; "This book is&nbsp;stimulating and thought-provoking....The issues&nbsp;it raises range well beyond the confines of the case-studies of the three theologians examined and have relevance outside the particular context of Hitler's Germany....That the book compels the reader to rethink some important questions about the susceptibility of intelligent human beings to as distasteful a phenomenon as fascism is an important achievement."&#x2014;Ian Kershaw, <i>History Today</i><br> "Ericksen's study...throws light on the kinds of perversion to which Christian beliefs and attitudes are easily susceptible, and is therefore timely and useful."<br>&#x2014;Gordon D.

Beginning with a central problem that distinguishes sociology from most other ways of looking at the world, Randall Collins examines the limits of human rationality and sociological theories of religion, showing how they open up a general theory of social rituals that holds the key to much of the rest of sociology. With these conceptual tools in hand, he invites students to ponder how sociological analysis can illuminate a variety of urgent topics--power, crime, sex, love, and the position of women in society--as it reveals both their visible social symbols and their paradoxical deep structures. In a new final chapter, Collins stakes out an important role for sociology in the information age, while coming full circle to the theories of rationality and ritual with which he began, showing that artificial intelligence can approximate human creativity only if it can take part in ritual interactions. Uniquely engaging, <em>Sociological Insight</em> dramatizes the major issues and concerns of sociology in a way that gets students thinking and talking, and whets their appetites for more.<br></p><p>Revised and expanded to incorporate recent research, this essential classic now offers a more comprehensive introduction to many of sociology&#39;s most interesting and elegant ideas, written with a grace and wit that have delighted a generation of students.Randall Collins is at University of California, Riverside.</p><h2>Statistical Mechanics</h2><p>Statistical Mechanics is the extended version of McQuarrie&#39;s earlier text - Statistical Thermodynamics (USB 1984).

This course, taught for several years at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, gives the student an introduction to the axiomatic method of economic analysis, without placing too heavy a demand on mathematical sophistication.The course begins with the basics of choice and revealed preference theory and then discusses numerical representations of ordinal preference. Models with uncertainty come next: First is von Neumann&#x2013;Morgenstern utility, and then choice under uncertainty with subjective uncertainty, using the formulation of Anscombe and Aumann, and then sketching the development of Savage's classic theory. Finally, the course delves into a number of special topics, including de Finetti's theorem, modeling choice on a part of a larger problem, dynamic choice, and the empirical evidence against the classic models.</p><p>David Kreps</p><h2>Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic Nursing</h2><p>...every nurse can benefit from reading this.

Drawing on the confessions of eight Mafiosi, Diego Gambetta develops an elegant analysis of the economic and political role of the Sicilian Mafia.</p><p>Blood ceremonies, obscure symbols, elaborate codes, brutal executions: the arcane remnants of a defunct culture? The Mafia, this book suggests, is not nearly as bizarre as all that, not nearly as remote as we might think. In fact, as Diego Gambetta&#39;s analysis unfolds, the Mafia begins to resemble any other business. In a society where trust is in short supply, this business sells protection, a guarantee of safe conduct for commercial and social transactions. It grudgingly shares the market with other concerns like itself, of which it is merely the most successful. The author develops his elegant economic theory with ample evidence, much of it based on the remarkable work done by Judge Giovanni Falcone and his colleagues in Palermo and Agrigento in the 1980s. Drawing on the confessions of eight Mafiosi and the trials their revelations triggered, Gambetta is able to explain all manner of peculiar Mafia marketing strategies that have been endlessly misinterpreted in the past. He makes illuminating - and unexpected - comparisons between the business of protection and ordinary industries, such as automotive insurance, and advertising. And he teases out the subtle distinctions between protection and extortion, in which the protector himself poses a threat. This new approach reshapes traditional interpretations of the Mafia - its origins, functions, and social consequences. Applying informal economic analysis, Gambetta shows how such a recognized evil can perform a real service, and how such a recognizable service can inflict great harm on a society.Diego Gambetta is Professor of Sociology at the University of Oxford and Official Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.</p><h2>Veterinary Hematology and Clinical Chemistry</h2><p><p><i>Veterinary Hematology and Clinical Chemistry, Second Edition</i> is a well-illustrated, user-friendly reference on veterinary laboratory diagnostic techniques and interpretation.

Everyone knows that the American welfare state is unusual--less expensive and extensive, later to develop and slower to grow, than comparable programs abroad. Yet, U.S. social policy does not stand out solely for its limits. American social spending is actually as high as spending is in many European nations. What is truly distinctive is that so many social welfare duties are handled not by the state, but by the private sector with government support. With sweeping historical reach and a wealth of statistical and cross-national evidence, The Divided Welfare State demonstrates that private social benefits have not merely been shaped by public policy, but have deeply influenced the politics of public social programs--to produce a social policy framework whose political and social effects are strikingly different than often assumed. At a time of fierce new debates about social policy, this book is essential to understanding the roots of America&#39;s distinctive model and its future possibilities. Jacob S.

Maxwell Perkins, legendary editor at Scribner&#39;s, nurtured the young Hemingway&#39;s talent, accepting his satirical novel Torrents of Spring (1926) in order to publish what would become a signature work of the twentieth century: The Sun Also Rises (1926). By early 1929 Hemingway had completed A Farewell to Arms. Hemingway&#39;s letters of this period also reflect landmark events in his personal life, including the dissolution of his first marriage, his remarriage, the birth of his second son, and the suicide of his father. As the volume ends in April 1929, Hemingway is setting off from Key West to return to Paris and standing on the cusp of celebrity as one of the major writers of his time.</p><p>The letters, many previously unpublished, of Volume 3 (1926-1929) explore Hemingway&#39;s move into the American mainstream and a lifelong publishing contract with Scribner&#39;s.

Now comes a brilliant portrait of the American Revolution, one that is compelling in its prose, fascinating in its details, and provocative in its fresh interpretations.<br><br>In <em>A Leap in the Dark</em>, John Ferling offers a magisterial new history that surges from the first rumblings of colonial protest to the volcanic election of 1800. Ferling's swift-moving narrative teems with fascinating details. We see Benjamin Franklin trying to decide if his loyalty was to Great Britain or to America, and we meet George Washington when he was a shrewd planter-businessman who discovered personal economic advantages to American independence. We encounter those who supported the war against Great Britain in 1776, but opposed independence because it was a "leap in the dark." Following the war, we hear talk in the North of secession from the United States. The author offers a gripping account of the most dramatic events of our history, showing just how closely fought were the struggle for independence, the adoption of the Constitution, and the later battle between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. Yet, without slowing the flow of events, he has also produced a landmark study of leadership and ideas. Here is all the erratic brilliance of Hamilton and Jefferson battling to shape the new nation, and here too is the passion and political shrewdness of revolutionaries, such as Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, and their Loyalist counterparts, Joseph Galloway and Thomas Hutchinson. Here as well are activists who are not so well known today, men like Abraham Yates, who battled for democratic change, and Theodore Sedgwick, who fought to preserve the political and social system of the colonial past. Ferling shows that throughout this period the epic political battles often resembled today's politics and the politicians--the founders--played a political hardball attendant with enmities, selfish motivations, and bitterness. The political stakes, this book demonstrates, were extraordinary: first to secure independence, then to determine the meaning of the American Revolution. <br><br>John Ferling has shown himself to be an insightful historian of our Revolution, and an unusually skillful writer. <em>A Leap in the Dark</em> is his masterpiece, work that provokes, enlightens, and entertains in full measure.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> is a Professor of History at the State University of West Georgia.

Those 2 million readers of David McCullough's <em>John Adams</em>, captivated by Adams's ardent patriotism and fiery opinions, will especially benefit from returning to the subject under the firm direction of a historian with a command of the scholarship that is matched by his gifts as a writer."--Joyce Appleby, <em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"This deft account of the American struggle for independence dispels the aura of inevitability that usually surrounds such histories by beginning its narrative not on the verge of the Revolution but twenty years earlier....Ferling vividly evokes the political turmoil of the post-Revolutionary years. Even as he takes the Founders off their pedestals, their accomplishments only gain in stature."--<em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Solid history that will refresh anyone's memory of the essential stories and figures in America's founding. And it will enlighten anyone about the origin of some current civic problems....His book provides not just political and intellectual history, but emotional history as well."--<em>Christian</em> <em>Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"The author's prose is smooth, but spellbinding. He brings to life the flinty, cross-grained Alexander Hamilton, the acute and enduring thoughts of John Adams, and some minor characters not found in most history books....Ferling has written several books on the Revolutionary period, but <em>A Leap in</em> <em>the Dark</em> may well be his masterpiece."--<em>Dallas Morning News</em><p></p><br>"Many Americans today see the period from 1754 to 1801 in American history as a rational progression from British colony to the independent United States. Nothing could be further from the truth, as shown by Ferling in this account of the Founding Fathers' struggles to do what had not been done before: create a nation. Throughout, he debunks popularly held notions....Ferling's intriguing narrative is filled with stories of Americans both famous and obsure."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"In <em>A Leap in the Dark</em>, John Ferling conveys the personal and contingent character of public affairs by skillfully interweaving capsule biographies of leaders into his analysis of events. His book, which stretches from the French and Indian War through the inauguration of President Thomas Jefferson, supplies a learned and readable narrative of American politics during a crucial era in the nation's history."--Richard Brown, University of Connecticut<p></p><br>"Questions about the establishment of the American Union are the focal point of this traditionally fashioned political history of Revolutionary America that moves gracefully from the period of the Seven Years' War through the presidential election of 1800.

Thoughtful guidelines are provided for weighing the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs. The book can be read sequentially or readers can dip into chapters on specific stages of research (basic design choices, selecting and sampling participants, addressing ethical issues) or data collection methods (surveys, interviews, experiments, observations, archival studies, and combined methods). Many chapter headings and subheadings are written as questions, helping readers quickly find the answers they need to make informed choices that will affect the later analysis and interpretation of their data. &nbsp; Useful features include: *Easy-to-navigate part and chapter structure. *Engaging research examples from a variety of fields. *End-of-chapter tables that summarize the main points covered. *Detailed suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter.<br> *Integration of data collection, sampling, and research ethics in one volume. *Comprehensive glossary.<p> See also Vogt et al.'s Selecting the Right Analyses for Your Data, which addresses the next steps in coding, analyzing, and interpreting data.</p></p><p><b>W.

From beginning to end, it is clear that you are reading the work of very accomplished researchers and educators. The authors use a particularly rich, colorful, and practical set of examples, including classic and contemporary research studies as well as wonderful day-to-day illustrations such as TV channel surfing to introduce the notion of sampling. Readers can pick and choose individual chapters or read straight through the entire book, depending on their needs. The summary tables are extraordinarily useful and can serve as a quick reference to chapter structure and content."--Karen M. Staller, PhD, School of Social Work, University of Michigan <br> "I am recommending this book as the core text for our required methods course at the graduate level. The reader is taken on a tour of the main research designs employed by social scientists, including various quantitative and qualitative, experimental and observational, and primary and secondary data designs. Highlighting how decisions about research design should be influenced by the nature of the research question, the authors also acknowledge when other factors come into play, including financial and ethical considerations. The text helps researchers decide when to use a particular research design; teaches how to choose appropriate methods for sampling, recruiting, and&nbsp; assigning treatments (for experiments); and explores the implications of these decisions. I like how the authors talk about debates in the literature and how they point out typical/common shortcomings of different approaches. Their frank language gives the book the feel of a trusted advisor providing honest advice."--Tracey LaPierre, PhD, Department of Sociology, University of Kansas<br> <br> "This book is on an essential topic--the questions it tackles are incredibly important in the social sciences. It reads like a field guide to conducting good research. I would recommend it to advanced undergraduates who need a handy reference or to graduate students who want one resource for their basic design, sampling, and ethics questions. It is accessible and easy to read. The authors present the process of research as full of choices that are best tackled by an informed researcher--no choice is universally the best one. The book emphasizes the importance of careful thought and weighing of pros and cons prior to conducting research."--Theresa DiDonato, PhD, Department of Psychology, Loyola University Maryland<br> <br> "The book is very well written and readable, a real plus! I really like the authors&#x2019; premise that the research question determines the choice of method, rather than vice versa."--Rosemary L. Hopcroft, PhD, Department of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Charlotte <br> "The use of questions as subheads is an effective pedagogical technique. Teaching students to turn a heading into a question and then reading the textbook section to find the answer to the question has a rich history as an instructional strategy."--Susan Kushner Benson, PhD, College of Education, University of Akron<br> <br> "This has been an excellent text for my Advanced Research Methods course. Vogt et al. offer a well-rounded approach that addresses methods, sampling, and ethical issues for each research design. The book provides nice coverage that is relatively discipline neutral--appealing to the social sciences as well as business. Abundant references to key studies can be used as article reviews to further enhance each topic. The authors also incorporate statistical analysis tools that are appropriate for the designs, going beyond basic statistical procedures to explain a number of advanced procedures, as well."--Debbie L.

The market revolution is the reason for this dramatic - and ironic - metamorphosis. The resulting tangled frameworks of democracy and capitalism still dominate the world as it responds to the Panic of 2008. Early Americans experienced what we now call &#34;modernization.&#34; The exhilaration - and pain - they endured have been repeated in nearly every part of the globe. Born of freedom and ambition, the market revolution in America fed on democracy and individualism even while it generated inequality, dependency, and unimagined wealth and power. John Lauritz Larson explores the lure of market capitalism and the beginnings of industrialization in the United States. His research combines an appreciation for enterprise and innovation with recognition of negative and unanticipated consequences of the transition to capitalism and relates economic change directly to American freedom and self-determination, links that remain entirely relevant today.</p><p>John Lauritz Larson explores the lure of market capitalism and the beginnings of industrialization in the United States.

Highly skilled artists created powerful representations reflecting and promoting this society and its values in icons, illuminated manuscripts, and mosaics and wallpaintings placed in domed churches and public buildings. This complete introduction to the whole period and range of Byzantine art combines immense breadth with interesting historical detail. <br><br>Robin Cormack overturns the myth that Byzantine art remained constant from the inauguration of Constantinople, its artistic centre, in the year 330 until the fall of the city to the Ottomans in 1453. He shows how the many political and religious upheavals of this period produced a wide range of styles and developments in art. This updated, colour edition includes new discoveries, a revised bibliography, and, in a new epilogue, a rethinking of <em>Byzantine Art</em> for the present day.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin Cormack </strong>is Professor Emeritus in the History of Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. He is author of <em>Writing in Gold: Byzantine Society and its Icons</em> (1985), <em>The Byzantine Eye: Collected Studies in Art and Patronage</em> (1989), <em>Painting the Soul: Icons, Death Masks, Shrouds</em> (1997), and <em>Icons</em> (2007, 2014).<br><br>He co-operated in the production of the film <em>A Window to Heaven</em> (Getty Foundation and Metropolitan Museum of Program for Art on Film, 1990), and was the Royal Academy consultant for the exhibitions <em>From Byzantine to El Greco</em> (1987), <em>The Art of Holy Russia: Icons from Moscow 1400-1660</em> (1998), and <em>Byzantium 330-1453</em> (2008-9).<br>Because Byzantine art portrays a society in change, defining the period and its contributions is a big undertaking. The author of several books on iconography and Byzantine art, Cormack (history of art, Univ. of London; deputy director, Courtauld Inst. of Art) only partially meets the challenge of making his subject understandable. The book's organization lends to its accessibility; Cormack breaks down the era's political and social developments, revealing their complexity, and time lines and sidebars make the topic more approachable. The trade paperback size (standard for this series) means smaller illustrations, which is a shortcoming. But the list of Internet links to museums with Byzantine art collections will be very useful for students. Despite the book's strengths, Cormack is not writing for the beginner, and some of this material will be over the heads of most readers. A respectable but not necessary addition to public and academic libraries that need the subject coverage. Karen Ellis, Nicholson Memorial Lib.

Doctorow celebrated the Constitution's bicentennial by reading it. "It is five thousand words long but reads like fifty thousand," he said. Distinguished legal scholar Garrett Epps--himself an award-winning novelist--disagrees. It's about 7,500 words. And Doctorow "missed a good deal of high rhetoric, many literary tropes, and even a trace of, if not wit, at least irony," he writes. Americans may venerate the Constitution, "but all too seldom is it read."<br><br>In <em>American Epic,</em> Epps takes us through a complete reading of the Constitution--even the "boring" parts--to achieve an appreciation of its power and a holistic understanding of what it says. In this book he seeks not to provide a definitive interpretation, but to listen to the language and ponder its meaning. He draws on four modes of reading: scriptural, legal, lyric, and epic. The Constitution's first three words, for example, sound spiritual--but Epps finds them to be more aspirational than prayer-like. "Prayers are addressed to someone . . . either an earthly king or a divine lord, and great care is taken to name the addressee. . . . This does the reverse. The speaker is 'the people,' the words addressed to the world at large." He turns the Second Amendment into a poem to illuminate its ambiguity. He notices oddities and omissions. The Constitution lays out rules for presidential appointment of officers, for example, but not removal. Should the Senate approve each firing? Can it withdraw its "advice and consent" and force a resignation? And he challenges himself, as seen in his surprising discussion of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in light of Article 4, which orders states to give "full faith and credit" to the acts of other states. <br><br>Wry, original, and surprising, <em>American Epic</em> is a scholarly and literary tour de force.<br></p><p>Americans may venerate the Constitution, but all too seldom do they read it.

The author's philosophy of literature is frequently cited as the first presentation of reader-response theory, but she differs from her successors in emphasizing both the reader and the text. Her "transactional" theory of literature examines the reciprocal nature of the literary experience and explains why meaning is neither "in" the text nor "in" the reader.

This interpretation is the basis for the claim that no paradigm shift, ideology critique, or new way of thinking can dispense with or overcome such modernist aspirations. In fact, the author argues, one can still detect the persistence of such aspirations and commitments in some of the harshest modernity critics, in Nietzsche and in Heidegger especially.</p> <p>This unique and engaging view of modernity is an essential read for students, academics, and researchers studying Modernism, 20th Century Philosophy, Social Theory, and Hegel and German Idealism.</p><b>Robert B.

Kittler begins by looking at European painting since the Renaissance in order to discern the principles according to which modern optical perception was organized. He also discusses the development of various mechanical devices, such as the camera obscura and the laterna magica, which were closely connected to the printing press and which played a pivotal role in the media war between the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation. <p> After examining this history, Kittler then addresses the ways in which images were first stored and made to move, through the development of photography and film. He discusses the competitive relationship between photography and painting as well as between film and theater, as innovations like the Baroque proscenium or "picture-frame" stage evolved from elements that would later constitute cinema. The central question, however, is the impact of film on the ancient monopoly of writing, as it not only provoked new forms of competition for novelists but also fundamentally altered the status of books.

Glenn Morrow's death occurred while he was less than halfway through the translation, which was completed by John Dillon. A major work of the great Neoplatonist philosopher, the commentary is an intellectual tour de force that greatly influenced later medieval and Renaissance thought.

Why do we bury people when they die? And what is at stake when we do? In <i>The Dominion of the Dead,</i> Robert Pogue Harrison considers the supreme importance of these questions to Western civilization, exploring the many places where the dead cohabit the world of the living&#x2014;the graves, images, literature, architecture, and monuments that house the dead in their afterlife among us.<br> <br> This elegantly conceived work devotes particular attention to the practice of burial. Harrison contends that we bury our dead to humanize the lands where we build our present and imagine our future. As long as the dead are interred in graves and tombs, they never truly depart from this world, but remain, if only symbolically, among the living. Spanning a broad range of examples, from the graves of our first human ancestors to the empty tomb of the Gospels to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Harrison also considers the authority of predecessors in both modern and premodern societies. Through inspired readings of major writers and thinkers such as Vico, Virgil, Dante, Pater, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Rilke, he argues that the buried dead form an essential foundation where future generations can retrieve their past, while burial grounds provide an important bedrock where past generations can preserve their legacy for the unborn.<br> <br> <i>The Dominion of the Dead</i> is a profound meditation on how the thought of death shapes the communion of the living. A work of enormous scope, intellect, and imagination, this book will speak to all who have suffered grief and loss.</p></p><p><b>Robert Pogue Harrison</b> is the Rosina Pierotti Professor in Italian Literature and chairs the Department of French and Italian at Stanford University. He is the author of <i>The Body of Beatrice</i> and <i>Forests: The Shadow of Civilization</i>, the latter published by the University of Chicago Press.Ranging over a variety of classical, biblical and modern philosophical sources, Harrison (Forests: The Shadow of Civilization) attempts nothing less than to reacquaint Western culture with its own thinking on death and, by doing so, to change its comportment toward mortality&#x2014;and toward life. Among the book&#x2019;s many hermeneutic passages is a chapter titled "Hic Jacet" (the "Here Lies" of Roman gravestones), which discusses Walt Whitman&#x2019;s "burial" of the Civil War in his poem "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x2019;d." Another chapter, titled "Hic Non Est" (or "He is not here" from the Gospel of Mark), unpacks historically variant meanings of the emptiness of Christ&#x2019;s tomb. Heidegger&#x2019;s thinking on "Being" permeates every chapter of this book; the discussion of how the living get appropriated by history via the dead is nothing short of fascinating. Passing subjects include Homer, Rimbaud, Thoreau, Descartes, Pater, Poe, Hopkins and Rilke&#x2014;to name just a few of the poets and thinkers whose work is discussed. A chaired professor of Italian literature at Stanford, Harrison also incorporates interpretations of lesser known portions of Petrarch, Leopardi, Vico, Pirandello, Croce, Ungaretti and Caproni. The result is something like a guide to the care of the self (and society) through an analysis of the care for the dead, written in a manner that is inimitable, provocative and intellectually compelling. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first in-depth and comprehensive look at his many accomplishments, <i>Henri Poincar�</i> explores all the fields that Poincar� touched, the debates sparked by his original investigations, and how his discoveries still contribute to society today.</p><br><p> Math historian Jeremy Gray shows that Poincar�'s influence was wide-ranging and permanent. His novel interpretation of non-Euclidean geometry challenged contemporary ideas about space, stirred heated discussion, and led to flourishing research. His work in topology began the modern study of the subject, recently highlighted by the successful resolution of the famous Poincar� conjecture. And Poincar�'s reformulation of celestial mechanics and discovery of chaotic motion started the modern theory of dynamical systems. In physics, his insights on the Lorentz group preceded Einstein's, and he was the first to indicate that space and time might be fundamentally atomic. Poincar� the public intellectual did not shy away from scientific controversy, and he defended mathematics against the attacks of logicians such as Bertrand Russell, opposed the views of Catholic apologists, and served as an expert witness in probability for the notorious Dreyfus case that polarized France.</p><br><p> Richly informed by letters and documents, <i>Henri Poincar�</i> demonstrates how one man's work revolutionized math, science, and the greater world.</p></p><p><p>"Poincar� was much more than a mathematician: he was a public intellectual, and a rare scientist who enthusiastically rose to the challenge of explaining and interpreting science for the public.

Absolutely. Rain is a resource that should be valued and celebrated, not merely treated as an urban design problem&#x2014;and yet, traditional stormwater treatment methods often range from ugly to forgettable. <i>Artful Rainwater Design</i> shows that it's possible to effectively manage runoff while also creating inviting, attractive landscapes.<br> &nbsp;<br> This beautifully illustrated, comprehensive guide explains how to design creative, yet practical, landscapes that treat on-site stormwater management as an opportunity to enhance site design.<i> Artful Rainwater Design</i> has three main parts: first, the book outlines five amenity-focused goals that might be highlighted in a project: education, recreation, safety, public relations, and aesthetic appeal. Next, it focuses on techniques for ecologically sustainable stormwater management that complement the amenity goals. Finally, it features diverse case studies that show how designers around the country are implementing principles of artful rainwater design.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Artful Rainwater Design</i> is a must-have resource for landscape architects, urban designers, civil engineers, and architects who won't let stormwater regulations cramp their style, and who understand that for a design to truly be sustainable, people must appreciate and love it. It is a tool for creating landscapes that celebrate rain for the life-giving resource it is&#x2014;and contribute to more sustainable, healthy, and even fun, built environments.</p><p>The go-to resource for designers creating new stormwater systems that are exciting, creative, and fun.<br>Stuart Echols and Eliza Pennypacker are faculty in Penn State's Department of Landscape Architecture. Echols' fascination with surface water systems led to his focus in stormwater management, while Pennypacker's study of American landscape taste led to her conviction that sustainable landscapes must be aesthetically appealing to the public. Their interests have combined since 2005 in the study of Artful Rainwater Design. <br></p><h2>String Theory and M-Theory: A Modern Introduction</h2><p>String theory is one of the most exciting and challenging areas of modern theoretical physics. This book guides the reader from the basics of string theory to recent developments. It introduces the basics of perturbative string theory, world-sheet supersymmetry, space-time supersymmetry, conformal field theory and the heterotic string, before describing modern developments, including D-branes, string dualities and M-theory. It then covers string geometry and flux compactifications, applications to cosmology and particle physics, black holes in string theory and M-theory, and the microscopic origin of black-hole entropy. It concludes with Matrix theory, the AdS/CFT duality and its generalizations. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in modern string theory, and will make an excellent textbook for a one-year course on string theory.

It presents a truth tree system based on the work of Jeffrey, as well as a natural deduction system inspired by that of Kalish and Montague. Both are very natural and easy to learn. The definition of a formula excludes free variables, and the deduction system uses <i>Show</i> lines; the combination allows rules to be stated very simply. <br> <p>The book's main innovation is its final part, which contains chapters on extensions and revisions of classical logic: modal logic, many-valued logic, fuzzy logic, intuitionistic logic, counterfactuals, deontic logic, common-sense reasoning, and quantified modal logic. These have been areas of great logical and philosophical interest over the past 40 years, but few other textbooks treat them in any depth. <i>Deduction</i> makes these areas accessible to introductory students. All chapters have discussions of the underlying semantics and present both truth tree and deduction systems.<br> </p> <p>New features in this edition, in addition to truth tree systems for classical and nonclassical logics, include new and simpler rules for modal logic, deontic logic, and counterfactuals; discussions of many-valued, fuzzy, and intuitionistic logics; an introduction to common-sense reasoning (nonmonotonic logic); and extensively reworked problem sets, designed to lead students gradually from easier to more difficult problems. This new edition also features web-based programs that make use of the book's methods. Each program is set up to give students symbolization problems, give them hints, grade their work, and do problems for them.</p><b>Daniel Bonevac</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin.

The focus is on the fundamental mathematical concepts and the realistic problem-solving via mathematical modeling rather than the development of algebraic skills that might be needed in calculus.Functions, Data, and Models presents college algebra in a way that differs from almost all college algebra books available today. Rather than going over material covered in high school courses the Gordons teach something new. Students are given an introduction to data analysis and mathematical modeling presented at a level that students with limited algebraic skills can understand. The book contains a rich set of exercises, many of which use real data.</p><p><p>Sheldon Gordon was born in New York City. He received his undergraduate training at Polytechnic Institute of New York and his graduate training at McGill University in Montreal, where he earned an MSc and a Ph.D. in mathematics. He is Johnson Professor of Mathematics at Farmingdale State College, a SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor and the recipient of the Metropolitan New York Section's Distinguished Teaching Award, among other honors. He is the author of almost 200 articles on mathematics and mathematics education.</p><p>Florence Gordon was born in Montreal, Canada and received her undergraduate and graduate training at McGill University, where she majored in mathematical statistics and earned a BSc, MSc, and Ph.D. She is a Professor Emeritus at New York Institute of Technology. She is the author of over 75 articles on statistics, mathematics education and statistical education.</p>Sheldon Gordon (Farmingdale State College) and Florence Gordon (NY Institute of Technology) have written many mathematics-related books and articles. In this endeavor, they work as a team to show how algebra is used in the "real world." On initial viewing, <i>Functions, Data and Models</i> may seem like a typical textbook, with all the usual key parts, including appendixes and answers to selected problems in the back of the book. However, on closer examination, readers will see and understand how the eight-chapter work differs from classic algebra books. The detailed preface includes messages for the student, messages for the instructor, and information on the book's philosophy. Some sections are standard for all textbooks; for example, the authors introduce a topic and provide example problems along with problems to be solved at the end of the section. The difference is that the problems are about subjects with which all students are familiar,e.g., sports, weather, money, and food. Chapter 2 uses a problem about cooking a turkey to help students understand models and predictions. There are also many useful illustrations throughout. The book would be a great resource for any algebra course. Highly recommended. --K.D. Holton, CHOICE Magazine --K.D. Holton, CHOICE Magazine<br><br>This textbook certainly sets the hook early when authors explain in the preface that the book's philosophy is to allow students to focus on mathematical ideas, not mathematical calculations. In contrast to many traditional college algebra texts that emphasize algebraic manipulations (which students may rarely need in their future careers), this text seeks to "meet the changing and qualitative needs of most other disciplines" (p. xi) by focusing more on graphical, numerical, and statistical methods. The authors have written a very dense text that begins with basic statistical ideas in Chapter 1 and then delves into a deeper discussion of functions in Chapters 2-8. The general content includes exploration into exponential, power, polynomial, and periodic functions, with an emphasis on modeling and interpreting data sets within an appropriate mathematical context. Every section is filled with real-world data, displayed in both tabular and plotted formats, perfect for the visual learner. I was pleasantly surprised that there were only a few equations or formulas highlighted by square boxes, a wonderful contrast to the typical mathematics text that speaks to this book's different philosophy. An aspect of the text that I found particularly refreshing was the inclusion of "Thought Experiments" peppered throughout many sections. These thinking exercises require students to interpret what they have read before they dive into solving any of the potential problems available at the end of each section. Additionally, the authors have included several "Virtual Laboratories," which are short applied projects on different topics that include physics, chemistry, biology, and meteorology. As the authors point out in the introduction to this text, it contains enough material (in both depth and variety) to cover two semesters' worth of study. On the other hand, the interested instructor could easily design a syllabus covering a limited number of topics from the book to address the needs of a semester-long course. I highly recommend this text to instructors who seek to cultivate creativity and critical thinking in their college-algebra-level students. --Hilary Fletcher, Mathematics and Computer Education</p><h2>Thoreau&#39;s Walden (Cliffs Notes)</h2><p>The original CliffsNotes study guides offer expert commentary on major themes, plots, characters, literary devices, and historical background.

A change in sensibilities, however, read Rome s brutal invasion and conquest of northern Europe as problematic, if not disturbing. But questions about the validity of Rome s actions and of Caesar s, especially in his later <i>Bellum Civile</i> are precisely what make these commentaries compelling to read and to discuss. Additional selections from Caesar s letters, speeches, and poetry offer fresh perspectives on his stylistic versatility. Tatum s commentary guides readers through it all, pointing up Caesar s significance as a representative of his age, culture, and class, while not skirting issues raised by the intriguingly unsimple mentality that gave us these works.<br> Introduction to Caesar s life, times, works, and style<br> 588 lines of unadapted Latin text selected from Caesar s two historical commentaries as well as from his extant correspondence, oratory, and poetry: <i>Bellum Gallicum</i> BOOK 1: 1.1 1.4, 2.1 3.1, 7, 11 12, 34 36; BOOK 2: 19.6 22.2; BOOK 5: 27; BOOK 6: 13 14, 16, 21, 24 <i>Bellum Civile</i> BOOK 1: 3 4, 7, 22 23; BOOK 2: 31 32; BOOK 3: 1, 57, 103.2 104.3 Cicero <i>Ad Atticum</i> 9.7C (Caesar to Oppius and Cornelius), 10.8B (Caesar to Cicero) Suetonius <i>Vita Divi Iulii</i> 6 (fragment of Caesar s funeral oration for his aunt Julia) Suetonius <i>Vita Terentii</i> 7 (Caesar s poem on Terence)<br> Notes at the back and complete vocabulary<br> Appendix on Latin prose rhythm<br> Three maps and three illustrations<br></p><p>W. Jeffrey Tatum is Professor of Classics at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. He is the author of The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina, 1999) and Always I am Caesar (Blackwell, 2008), as well as articles and book chapters on Roman history and Latin literature.Caesar seems to be back in vogue these days. Consider Tatum's bibliography, which runs four pages despite restricting itself mostly to works written in the last twenty years. The case could be made that there is not exactly a paucity of texts to use if you are looking to study or teach him. In that context, what does Tatum's volume, one of Bolchazy-Carducci's Latin Reader series, have that other readers lack? The answer, I think, is in the unique passages in the reader and the thorough and subtle cultural and stylistic apparatus for understanding them Tatum provides. Tatum focuses on Caesar's 'extraordinary versatility as a stylist as well as ... his significance as a representative of his age, culture, and class'(xi), and it is true that Tatum draws his selections from a wide variety of Caesar's writings meant to showcase this versatility. It also means that Tatum is prioritizing variety over theme. While many of the selections seem chosen to showcase Caesar's use of narrative as propaganda, some, like Caesar's account of Pompey's death, seem to stand in isolation.<p>Over half of the Latin Tatum selects comes from the Bellum Gallicum,and these selections are more or less the ones that you would expect to see. The reader begins with the celebrated Gallia est omnis divisa, then moves into the Helvetian campaign. Tatum chooses passages here that highlight Caesar as a propagandist and apologist, and supports this characterization with background essays and notes that provide context for why the Romans feared Celtic tribes and how Caesar took pains to justify his involvement. Ariovistus is up next, followed by the Nervii's ambush of Caesar's forces from BG 2.19-22. Tatum, stopping briefly to hear Ambiorix's speech in BG 5.27, ends his tour with ethnographies of the Celts and Germans from BG 7. Tatum's supporting materials here are especially interesting, since he discusses not only Caesar's possible sources but also compares his account with other ethnographies of the area, including Tacitus' Germania.</p><p>Tatum shifts his strategy for the Bellum Civile, choosing fewer but longer passages. Tatum's next two selections reveal action in the war through the surrender at Corfinium and Curio's rousing speech before his ultimate defeat in Africa. The last trio of passages show Caesar's lenitas, his attempts to persuade aristocrats by speech rather than violence, and finally the scene of Pompey's death. What is most interesting and unusual is Tatum's inclusion of lesser known selections of Caesar's works: two of his letters, a fragment of the funeral oration for his aunt, and a clever poem about his opinion of Terence as a dimidiate Menander (28). I would wager that most students first approach Caesar through a lens formed by popular cultural images of the man as a military genius and dictator; to see Caesar as an author of a wide range of genres is, therefore, bound to be eye-opening. Caesar's poem, found in Suetonius' bibliography of Terence, is sure to delight, and it offers a rare glimpse into his wit and his ability to condemn while praising.</p><p>Tatum devotes most of the space in the reader to commentary and grammatical xplanations. The reader's best parts are Tatum's deft discussions of the cultural, historical, and stylistic features of each selection. In particular, Tatum's comments often persuade the student to examine motive and style in clever and interesting ways. He also gives plenty of explanations for culturally-laden terms like officium and hospitium, or technical terms such as rogatio, fides, or ambitus so that a student can attain a greater degree of understanding of the point of an argument.</p><p>The intermediate students for whom the series is designed are first beginning to think about how style and word order affect the meaning and presentation of argument, and Tatum devotes much space to this idea. --Thomas J. Howell, Belchertown High School, Belchertown, Mass.<br><br>Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers have long been known for their exemplary publishing lists in the field of Latin and Greek language studies curriculum materials. Of special note for the study of Latin are their four volume 'Reader' series, each of which is authored by academic experts in the language and in their ability to craft curriculum materials that are thoroughly 'student friendly'. Four volumes that should be a part of every personal, professional, and academic library Latin Studies reference collection includes: <i>A Caesar Reader: Selections from Bellum Gallicum and Bellum Civile, and from Caesar's Letters, Speeches, and Poetry</i> (9780865166967, $19.00) by W. Jeffrey Tatum, Ronnie Ancona and Laurie Haight Keenan; <i>A Suetonius Reader: Selections from the Lives of the Caesars and the Life of Horace</i> (9780865167162, $19.00) by Josiah Osgood; <i>A Lucan Reader: Selections from Civil War</i> (9780865166615, $19.00) by Susanna Braund; and <i>A Roman Verse Satire Reader: Selections from Lucilius, Horace, Persius, and Juvenal</i> (9780865166851, $19.00) by Catherine Keane.

Beginning with studies by the U.S. Secret Service twenty years ago, the research and interest in this field has accelerated over the past decade with published scholarship and emerging professional organizations. <br><br><em>International Handbook of Threat Assessment</em> offers a definition of the foundations of threat assessment, systematically explores its fields of practice, and provides information and instruction on the best practices of threat assessment. The volume is divided into three sections. Section I defines the difference between threat assessment and traditional violence risk assessment and discusses threat assessment terminology and practice, contemporary understanding of threats, warning behaviors concerning targeted violence, and the legal basis of threats and targeted violence interventions. Section II elaborates on the various domains of threat assessment, such as workplace violence, public figure attacks, school and campus violence, insider threats, honor-based violence, computer-modeling of violent intent, targeted domestic violence, anonymous threats, and cyberthreats. Section III presents the functions of a number of threat assessment individuals and units, including the UK Fixated Threat Assessment Centre, the LAPD Threat Management Unit, Australia's Problem Behaviour Program, and the U.S. Navy Criminal Investigative Service, among others. This book will serve as the standard reference volume in the field of threat assessment and will be invaluable to mental health and criminal justice professionals who practice threat assessment or are interested in understanding this new field of research.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dr. J.

His theory is a <em>manipulationist</em> account, proposing that causal and explanatory relationships are relationships that are potentially exploitable for purposes of manipulation and control. This account has its roots in the commonsense idea that causes are means for bringing about effects; but it also draws on a long tradition of work in experimental design, econometrics, and statistics. <br><br>Woodward shows how these ideas may be generalized to other areas of science from the social scientific and biomedical contexts for which they were originally designed. He also provides philosophical foundations for the manipulationist approach, drawing out its implications, comparing it with alternative approaches, and defending it from common criticisms. In doing so, he shows how the manipulationist account both illuminates important features of successful causal explanation in the natural and social sciences, and avoids the counterexamples and difficulties that infect alternative approaches, from the deductive-nomological model onwards.<br><br><em>Making Things Happen</em> will interest philosophers working in the philosophy of science, the philosophy of social science, and metaphysics, and as well as anyone interested in causation, explanation, and scientific methodology.<br></p><p><br><strong>James Woodward</strong> is the author of a number of articles in the philosophy of science.

Today everything from a fetishist's dream appears on the fashion runways. Although some people regard fetish fashion as exploitative and misogynistic, others interpret it as a positive Amazonian statement--couture Catwoman. But the connection between fashion and fetishism goes far beyond a few couture collections. For the past thirty years, the iconography of sexual fetishism has been increasingly assimilated into popular culture. Before Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, there was Mrs. Peel, heroine of the 1960s television show "The Avengers," who wore a black leather catsuit modeled on a real fetish costume. Street styles like punk and the gay "leatherman" look also testify to the influence of fetishism.<br> The concept of fetishism has recently assumed a growing importance in critical thinking about the cultural construction of sexuality. Yet until now no scholar with an in-depth knowledge of fashion history has studied the actual clothing fetishes themselves. Nor has there been a serious exploration of the historical relationship between fashion and fetishism, although erotic styles have changed significantly and "sexual chic" has become increasingly conspicuous.<br> Cultural historian Valerie Steele has devoted much of her career to the study of the relationship between clothing and sexuality, and is uniquely qualified to write this book. Marshalling a dazzling array of evidence from pornography, psychology, and history, as well as interviews with individuals involved in sexual fetishism, sadomasochism, and cross-dressing, Steele illuminates the complex relationship between appearance and identity. Based on years of research, her book <em>Fetish: Fashion, Sex &amp; Power</em> explains how a paradigm shift in attitudes toward sex and gender has given rise to the phenomenon of fetish fashion.<br> "Steele is to fetish dressing what Anne Rice is to vampires," writes Christa Worthington of <em>Elle</em> magazine, "the intellectual interpreter of...wishes beyond our ken." According to Steele, fetishism shows how human sexuality is never just a matter of doing what comes naturally; fantasy always plays an important role. Steele provides provocative answers to such questions as: Why is black regarded as the sexiest color? Is fetishizing the norm for males? Does fetish fashion reflect a fear of AIDS? And why do so many people love shoes?<br></p><p>Because this is Valerie Steele&#39;s second book on the topic of fetishistic clothing, her opening statements that she is an outsider to the paraphilias and perversions that she discusses seems a bit hollow. When she says that she is only &#34;a cultural historian specializing in fashion&#34; there&#39;s no need to fear: while the book is rigorously researched and loaded with valuable bibliographic references to previous researchers in the area, it&#39;s apparent that underneath her cool prose Steele really gets a kick out of her subject, if only on an intellectual level. Dividing her book into sections based on the various fetishes (corsets, shoes, second-skin fabrics, underwear), Steele shows a remarkable facility with the history and trivia of each item of clothing. This produces some amusing juxtapositions, such as when she reveals little-known information about the Chinese practice of footbinding, and a page later presents a Tom of Finland picture of a nude man surrounded by motorcycle-booted feet. There are plenty of drawings and photographs here, ostensibly to supplement the reading. Photos range from 19th-century Viennese ultra-high-heeled shoes to contemporary neo- gothic hipster chicks in corsets and leather. This is obviously not a book for children, but it&#39;s also far more than a collection of erotica in that it presents an informative and well-researched history of fetishism and the theories that have been put forward to explain it.<br><strong>Valerie Steele</strong> is a cultural historian specializing in the history of fashion.

Peter Calthorpe shows us what is possible using real world examples of innovative design strategies and forward-thinking policies that are already changing the way we live.<br> &nbsp;<br> This provocative and engaging work emerges from Calthorpe&#x2019;s belief that, just as the last fifty years produced massive changes in our culture, economy and environment, the next fifty will generate changes of an even more profound nature.

Each chapter, written by experts in their field, will provide an up-to-date review and present the major discoveries and innovations in the field. Important technical advances such as satellite telemetry and time-depth-recorders will be described in boxes.</p><p>This volume brings together some of the best known and respected experts in the field of marine mammal biology to provide a cohesive and accessible text. A very broad scope of topics and examples are classified as marine mammals; the whales, dolphins and porpoises (cetaceans), seals, sea lions, fur seals and walruses (pinnipeds), manatees and dugongs (sirenians), and the sea otter and polar bear (carnivores). Topics covered include diversity, distribution and evolutionary patterns, anatomical and physiological adaptations, vocal and social behaviour, problem solving and memory, feeding ecology and energetics, life history and reproductive strategies, patterns of movement and population genetics, and conservation and management. Chapters are fully cross-referenced and illustrated, and the citations are numerous and current. All chapters are united by the theme of evolutionary context, addressing the question of how these diverse mammalian species have adapted to life in the oceans. The intended audience includes students of marine biology, ecology and evolution, as well as professionals with an interest in marine mammals, evolutionary pattern and process, zoology and ecology.<b><br> </b> <p><b>Rus Hoelzel</b> is a molecular ecologist who has studies marine mammal populations for over 20 years, including work in the field with various species in North America, South America, Europe, Africa and the South Atlantic. Currently at the University of Durham, he has also worked at Cambridge University, Imperial College and the US National Cancer Institute. He has edited four other books and is editor-in-chief of the journal Conservation Genetics. His research interests include conservation and population genetics, evolution, behavioural ecology and feeding ecology. His work with marine mammals has included studies on vocal behaviour, feeding ecology, reproductive strategy, population genetic structure and the impact of population bottlenecks on genetic diversity.</p></p><h2>The Matrix of the Mind: Object Relations and the Psychoanalytic Dialogue</h2><p>This book is exciting, original, and above all accessible&#x2013;a rare combination for a text which deals in depth with psychoanalytical theory. Non-analysts are frequently both baffled and alienated by the jargon and the complexity of works which extend psychoanalytical thinking, but Ogden is revealed in this book as an outstanding communicator as well as a major theoretician. The book's subtitle is a guide to the main focus of the work, which reinterprets the work of Melanie Klein, with its focus on phantasy, in relation to the biological determinants of perception and the meaning and organization of experience in the interpersonal setting of human growth and development. Ogden re-interprets Klein to illuminate Freudian instinct theory, using the contributions of Bion, Fairbairn, and particularly Winnicott&#x2013;British object relations theorists&#x2013;to clarify and extend aspects of their work and to move towards an impressive exposition of the way in which the human mind develops." <br><b>&#x2013;Pamela M. Ashurst, <i>The British Journal of Psychiatry</i></b><br><br><i>A Jason Aronson Book</i></p><p><b>Thomas H. Ogden</b>, M.D., is a graduate of Amherst College, the Yale School of Medicine, and the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute. He has served as an associate psychiatrist at the Tavistock Clinic, London, and is currently co-director of the Center for the Advanced Study of the Psychoses, a member of the faculty of the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, and a supervising and personal analyst at the Psychoanalytic Institute of Northern California. He teaches, supervises, and maintains a private practice of psychoanalysis in San Francisco.All who are acquainted with Thomas Ogden's papers on psychoanalysis and with his authoritative book Projective Identification and Psychotherapeutic Technique have eagerly awaited the publication of <i>The Matrix of the Mind</i>. Ogden supplies an approach to Kleinian theory that is both eminently appreciative and incisively critical. He comprehensively and brilliantly surveys the development of the concept of internal objects and relationships. The chapters dealing with Winnicott's theoretical and clinical contribution to the history of psychoanalytic thought are particularly profound and original. This eminently readable and thought-provoking book will be read with interest not only by dedicated psychotherapeutic workers in varied fields, but also by all those who take an intelligent interest in the way human beings function psychologically. (Joyce McDougall, D. Ed.)<br><br>[Ogden's] ideas will eventually have the importance of transference and countertransference and projection and projective identification in psychoanalytic theory. Ogden's writing is crisp and clear when combining welters of seemingly confusing concepts. It taps the root of yet another American grain. The British came, they saw, and psychologists will never be the same. We are building a new dialectic of the psychology and understanding of deep structures and matrices of the mind. (Harold J. Fine <i>Contemporary Psychology</i>)<br><br>The Matrix of the Mind provides us with the most profound understanding to date of both the strengths and the weaknesses of Melanie Klein. In so doing, Ogden establishes himself as one of the most eloquent American spokesmen for the British object relations school. [Ogden] is an independent thinker who appreciates the dialectical nature of the psychoanalytic endeavor. The Freudian thesis requires the Kleinian antithesis in Ogden's view, and neither Freud nor Klein can be fully understood without understanding the other. Ogden does not hesitate to point out the shortcomings of Klein; and he persuasively demonstrates that the contributions of Winnicott, particularly those concerning the potential space, fill the void left by the formulations of Klein.As an experienced psychoanalytic therapist involved in the treatment of severely disturbed patients, Ogden repeatedly anchors his brilliant conceptual thinking to the bedrock of clinical data. The test of any psychoanalytic theory is in its application to the understanding of patients, and it is here that the author's thinking is vindicated. The clinician who reads this volume will be richly rewarded by his expanded understanding of his patients and of the therapeutic process. (Glen O.

Sebald. A novel of self-questioning and self-discovery, <i>Slow Homecoming</i> is a singular odyssey, an escape from the distractions of the modern world and the unhappy consciousness, a voyage that is fraught and fearful but ultimately restorative, ending on an unexpected note of joy. <br><br>The book begins in America. Writing with the jarring intensity of his early work, Handke introduces Valentin Sorger, a troubled geologist who has gone to Alaska to lose himself in his work, but now feels drawn back home: on his way to Europe he moves in ominous disorientation through the great cities of America. The second part of the book, &#x201c;The Lesson of Mont Sainte-Victoire,&#x201d; identifies Sorger as a projection of the author, who now writes directly about his own struggle to reconstitute himself and his art by undertaking a pilgrimage to the great mountain that C�zanne painted again and again. Finally, &#x201c;Child Story&#x201d; is a beautifully observed, deeply moving account of a new father&#x2014;not so much Sorger or the author as a kind of Everyman&#x2014;and his love for his growing daughter.</p><p><b>Peter Handke</b> was born in Griffen, Austria, in 1942. He came to early prominence in the 1960s for such experimental plays as <i>Kaspar</i> and rapidly established himself asone of the most respected German-language writers of his generation, producing fiction, translations, memoirs, screenplays, and essays. Among his best-known novels are <i>The Goalie&#x2019;s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick</i>, <i>Repetition</i>, and <i>My Year in the No-Man&#x2019;s Bay</i>. He has directed adaptions of his novels <i>The Left-Handed Woman</i> and <i>Absence</i> and collaborated with filmmaker Wim Wenders on four films, including <i>Wings of Desire</i>. In addition to <i>Slow Homecoming</i>, NYRB Classics has also published Handke&#x2019;s novel <i>Short Letter, Long Farewell</i> and his memoir <i>A Sorrow Beyond Dreams</i>.<br><br><b>Benjamin Kunke</b>l is the author of the novel <i>Indecision</i> and a founding editor of <i>n+1</i> magazine.<br><br><b>Ralph Manheim</b> (1907&#x2013;1992) translated G�nter Grass, Louis-Ferdinand C�line, Hermann Hesse, and Martin Heidegger, along with many other German and French authors.Slow Homecoming<br><i>The Long Way Around</i><i>Then, as I stumbled headlong down the path, there was suddenly a form ...</i><i>One /</i><i>The Primordial Forms</i>Sorger had outlived several of those who had become close to him; he had ceased to long for anything, but often felt a selfless love of existence and at times a need for salvation so palpable that it weighed on his eyelids. Capable of a tranquil harmony, a serene strength that could transfer itself to others, yet too easily wounded by the power of facts, he knew desolation, wanted responsibility, and was imbued with the search for forms, the desire to differentiate and describe them, and not only out of doors ("in the field"), where this often tormenting but sometimes gratifying and at its best triumphant activity was his profession.At the end of the working day, in the light-gray gabled wooden house at the edge of the mainly Indian settlement in the Far North of the other continent, which for some months had been serving him and his colleague Lauffer as both laboratory and dwelling, he slipped the protective covers on the microscopes and binoculars he had been using alternately and, his face still distorted by the frequent changes from short view to long view and back, passed through the episodic space created by the sunset light and the hovering woolly-white seeds of the dwarf poplars, an after-work corridor, as it were, to "his" beach.A clay platform so low that he could have jumped off. There began the immense realm of the glittering river, extending to the whole circle of the horizon, flooding the continental shelf from east to west and at the same time meandering northward and southward through the sparsely settled but to all intents and purposes uninhabited lowlands. Narrowed, because it was the dry season and the glaciers had stopped melting, behind first a broad bank of gravel and shale and then a muddy slope, the river at Sorger's feet sent long, light sea waves beating against the land.Another thing that made the valley look like a body of standing water was that it reached out to the horizon on all sides but that, because of the river's meanderings, the lines of the horizon were formed not by streams flowing from east to west but by dry land, by the banks of that bend in the river surmounted by dwarf poplars and the tops of primeval conifers, which, though in reality sparse and stunted, seemed from a distance to form serried files.True, this apparent lake, bounded on all sides by land that looked to be flat, flowed at a speed hard to estimate, silently and quite smoothly except for the bathtub-like lapping of the waves on the muddy beach--one might have said a foreign body, filling the entire plain, mirrored yellow by the sunset sky, perceptible at first glance only as wetness, dotted here and there with island specks and sandbanks, they too lying flat in the hazy evening air. Only the eddies that formed over unseen depressions in the sand-and-gravel riverbed, swiftly circling funnels in the otherwise metallic yellow surface, were not yellow but, because of their sharper angle to the sky, a remote daylight blue from within which, amid the almost silent flow, soft brooklike gurglings could be heard.Sorger was buoyed by the thought that the months he had spent observing this wilderness, learning (approximately) its forms and their genesis, had made it his own private domain. Destructive as they may have been (and still were) in the objective world, the forces that went to make up this landscape, in becoming present to him along with the great flowing water, its eddies and rapids, without mental effort, through the perceptive process alone, were transformed by their own laws into a benign inner force, which calmed him and gave him strength. He believed in his science, because it helped him to feel whatever place he was in; far from putting him off, his consciousness of standing on a flat beach while the opposite shore, miles away and scarcely visible through the islands, was slightly steeper, and of being able to attribute this strange asymmetry to the rotation of the earth, gave him the feeling that the planet earth was a civilized, homelike, intelligible place, a feeling that made his mind playful and his body resilient.This state of mind was also favored by the fleeting thought that while poplar seeds were drifting through the air, the pebbles on the riverbed were at the same time shifting unseen, rolling or slowly leaping over one another, enveloped in clouds of mud and propelled by waves deep below the surface which he could sense rather than infer. Wherever he was, Sorger tried to experience minute burlesque processes of this kind, which sometimes merely amused him but sometimes aroused him and filled his whole being.For some years--since he had been spending most of his time alone--he had felt the need to sense the place where he was at the moment: to know distances, apprehend angles of inclination; to gain some idea of the composition and stratification of the soil he was standingon, at least down to a certain depth; to supply himself, by measurement and delimitation, with spaces which were hardly more than "forms on paper" but which, for a short while at least, enabled him to construct himself and make himself invulnerable.Sorger needed nature, but not only in its "unspoiled" state; in big cities, for example, he was satisfied to gain awareness of scarcely perceptible asphalt-covered humps and hollows, gentle rises and falls in the pavement, of church floors or stone stairs, worn with the steps of the centuries; or, visiting an unknown high-rise building, to fancy himself passing vertically through all the floors from roof to basement, and, finally, to daydream its granite foundations--until, in the end, orientation and the breathing space (and hence self-confidence) indispensable to life engendered each other.He had the ability (not constant, to be sure, but sporadic and accidental, though his profession made the accident possible and gave it some constancy) to call upon those parts of the world to which he had become accustomed in his work for help, or merely to conjure them up for the entertainment of himself and others, with all their specifications, their degrees of longitude and latitude, their light and wind conditions, their planetary conjunctions, as eternally peaceful images, belonging to everyone and no one, and betokening events still to be imagined.In every new scene, which might at first sight seem surveyable in its uniformity or picturesque in its contrasts, but in either case intelligible, this moment of naive familiarity was followed, often definitively, by a bewildered sense, akin to a loss of balance, of once again confronting a mere stage set, and a familiar one at that, further intensified by a sense of guilt at being, here too, "out ofplace." In the course of time, it had therefore become a passion with Sorger, while enduring this first feeling of emptiness, to win back these quickly squandered places by observing and taking notes. Unable, because he had long been nowhere at home, to recapture his self within his own four walls after such touristic humiliations by regions of the earth, he saw each new place as his only hope; if he did not (often reluctantly) commit himself to it through hard work, there would be no refuge for him in the scenes of his past--but then with luck, in times of exhaustion, all his localities joined together, the particular, freshly conquered one with those that had gone before, and formed a dome encompassing heaven and earth, a sanctuary, which was not only private but also open to others.After his initial irritation with a nature too quick to promise itself and even quicker to withdraw, Sorger was obliged, on pain of losing himself, to immerse himself in it. He was obliged to take the environing world seriously in the least of its forms--a groove in the rock, a change of color in the mud, a windblown pile of sand at the foot of a plant--as seriously as only a child can do, in order to keep himself, who scarcely belonged anywhere, who was nowhere at home, together, for whom he had no idea; there were times when this cost him a furious effort at self-conquest.For whom was he keeping himself together? Sorger knew that in devoting himself to his science he was to some extent practicing a religion. It was his work that enabled him, time and again, to enter into relationships, to choose and be chosen. By whom? No matter, as long as he was choosable.Indeed, his study of the earth's forms, carried on without fanaticism but so intensely that little by little hegained awareness of his own form in the process, had thus far saved his soul by differentiating him from the Great Formlessness and its dangerous moods and caprices.And what of others? Thus far in his profession Sorger had done no work expressly useful to anyone, let alone benefiting a community; he had neither drilled for oil nor predicted an earthquake nor even contributed to a construction project by testing the solidity of the subsoil. But of one thing he was sure--without the effort he made to endure the strangeness of every region of the earth, to read the landscape with the available means and give an orderly account of his reading, he would not have been fit company for anyone.He did not believe in his science as a kind of nature religion; on the contrary, his always "measured" practice of his profession (in the eyes of the chaotic and often charmingly erratic Lauffer, Sorger's work was always "made to measure") was at the same time an exercise in trusting the world, for the measured quality of his technical manipulations but also his personal, everyday movements resided in his constant attempt at meditation, which sometimes made him fumble majestically about in such places as bathrooms, kitchens, and tool sheds. Sorger's faith was directed at nothing; when successful, it merely enabled him to participate in "its object" (a stone with a hole in it, or perhaps only a shoe on the table, or a thread on the lens of his microscope) and endowed him, who at such times was able, despite his frequent anguish, to feel like a real scientist, with humor. And then, caught up in a gentle vibration, he would simply look at his world more closely.At such times of selfless tenderness (in his fleeting moments of hope he thought himself a fool) Sorger was not godlike; he just knew, for a brief moment--but onethat could be perpetuated with the help of forms--what was good and beautiful.He longed, it is true, for a faith directed at something, though he could not conceive of a God; but in moments of distress he noticed that he positively thirsted--an automatic compulsion?--to <i>share</i> in the thought of God. (Sometimes he tried to be pious--he did not succeed; but then he was sure that "the gods" understood him.)Did he envy the unflagging believers, the hosts of the already saved? In any event, he was touched by their freedom from moods, their easy transitions between gravity and good cheer, their enduring, benevolent, <i>good</i> extroversion; often enough he himself was simply <i>not good</i>, and to this he could not resign himself; too often he greeted some new object with loquacious enthusiasm and almost immediately thereafter turned away from it in silent revulsion--instead of responding to it once and for all with overarching humor.Nevertheless, he could not hobnob with believers. He understood them, but he could not speak their language, because he had no language or because in his exceptional states of credulity he would have spoken a language foreign to them; in the "dark night of their faith," where there was no speaking in tongues, they could not have understood him.On the other hand, for all his conviction, Sorger never ceased to regard the linguistic formulas of his science as a hoax; the rites in which it apprehended the landscape, its conventions of description and nomenclature, its conception of time and space, struck him as dubious. Having to use a language that had grown out of the history of mankind to describe the different movements and formations of the earth still made his head swim, and often he found it quite impossible to take account of time alongwith the places he had set out to investigate. He suspected the possibility of an entirely different schema for representing the correlation between time and geological formations, and saw himself smiling craftily, as the over-turners of systems have always done (that had struck him in all their photographs), and he foisted his own little hoax on the world.And so Sorger, his thoughts made playful by his after-work elation, was able, while contemplating the yellow wilderness, to sense the desolation of a man who, without faith in the power of forms or rendered incapable of such faith by ignorance, might find himself, as in a nightmare, confronting this part of the world alone: his horror face to face with the Evil One at the irrevocable end of the world, unable to die of loneliness then and there--since there would no longer be a then and there--or even to be carried off by Satan--for even such names would have ceased to exist--but doomed to die of horror, for time, too, would have ceased to exist. The fluvial plain and the wide, flat sky over it suddenly looked to him like the two shells of an open bivalve, emanating the terrible, the poignantly voluptuous seduction of those who have died since the beginning of time.Involuntarily, wrenched away from his play, Sorger--as though he had been his own double, as though exposed for all time to whirling emptiness on his outcropping of clay, marl, and possibly gold dust--turned toward the civilized hinterland, where the bushy light-colored tails of watchdogs could be seen wagging in the shrubbery, where tufts of grass growing on the earthen roofs of Indian huts glittered, and where the "eternally other"--his name at the moment for his colleague Lauffer--in mud-caked high boots and characteristic multi-pocketed jacket, a sparkling magnifying glass hanging from his neck (hehad just come in from his fieldwork), was standing on the topmost wooden step outside the gabled house, his face and torso still in the sun, in the first perplexity of return to a place where he only happened to be living, for a time stiffly and awkwardly imitating Sorger's stance, like Sorger looking out over the great fluvial plain, smoking a cigarette--a strangely helpless figure, with the same pinched look on his face as the row of Indians lined up outside.The familiarity between these two friends expressed itself not in chumminess but in a politeness that was almost diffident. Subject as they were to moods, the outburst of moodiness that might occasionally have done them good was not possible. Though they were obliged to share their workroom, it was only at first that they felt in each other's way; in the bedroom as well--the house consisted only of those two rooms--each had his place without need of planning. A certain neighborliness was taken for granted, yet it seemed accidental when they did anything together; each went about his own affairs and even in the house each had his own itineraries. They didn't really eat together; one might be eating a regular meal; the other would sit down with him, and the first would issue an invitation: "Won't you have a glass of wine with me?" If one wanted music, the other wouldn't leave the room; he would stay, showing no express interest and gradually perhaps begin to listen, or even ask to have a piece repeated.Lauffer was a liar; Sorger, for all his impenetrable cal...</p><h2>The Miracles of Saint James</h2><p>This book offers the complete text of Book II of the Codex Calixtinus, the twenty-two miracles associated with St. James, including the famous miracle of the hanged boy, who revives when his father returns from his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. The introduction analyzes the types, places, and recipients of the miracles and discusses the appearances of St. James himself in these stories. This volume also presents the chapter 17 of Book I, the Veneranda dies sermon. This is a contemporary description of the necessity, the ways and means, and the dangers of making the Compostela pilgrimage. The author&#39;s diatribes against the abuses common on the route give the twentieth-century reader a fascinating view of life on pilgrimage. Introduction, notes, illustrations, bibliography, index.</p><p>In the year of Our Lord one thousand one hundred one, a certain sailor named Frisonus piloted a ship traveling over the sea and filled with pilgrims wishing to go to the Lord&#39;s sepulcher in the area of Jerusalem in order to pray there. At a certain point a Saracen named Avitus Maimon, wishing to take all the pilgrims away with him into the land of the Moabites, approached Frisonus&#39; ship for the purpose of doing combat. When the two boats - that of the Saracens and that of the Christians - came together and fought fiercely, Frisonus, outfitted with his metal breastplate and his helmet and his shield, fell between the two ships into the depths of the sea. When, through the mercy of God, he regained some strength, he began to call on Saint James within his heart, saying these words, &#34;Great and most glorious James, the indescribably pious apostle, whose altar I once kissed with my unworthy mouth, deign to free me together with all these Christians who are committed to you&#34;.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News</h2><p><p><b>Longlisted for the National Book Award for Nonfiction</b><br><b></b><br><b>&#x201c;There Kevin Young goes again, giving us books we greatly need, cleverly disguised as books we merely want.

Disturbingly, Young finds that fakery is woven from stereotype and suspicion, race being the most insidious American hoax of all. He chronicles how Barnum came to fame by displaying figures like Joice Heth, a black woman whom he pretended was the 161-year-old nursemaid to George Washington, and What Is It?, an African American man Barnum professed was a newly discovered missing link in evolution.<br><i></i><br><i>Bunk</i> then turns to the hoaxing of history and the ways that forgers, plagiarists, and journalistic fakers invent backstories and falsehoods to sell us lies about themselves and about the world in our own time, from pretend Native Americans Grey Owl and Nasdijj to the deadly imposture of Clark Rockefeller, from the made-up memoirs of James Frey to the identity theft of Rachel Dolezal. In this brilliant and timely work, Young asks what it means to live in a post-factual world of &#x201c;truthiness&#x201d; where everything is up for interpretation and everyone is subject to a pervasive cynicism that damages our ideas of reality, fact, and art.</p></p><p><b>Kevin Young</b> is the author of a previous book of nonfiction, <i>The Grey Album</i>, and eleven books of poetry, including <i>Blue Laws</i>, which was long-listed for the National Book Award.

He lives in Queensland. Steven Woolman&#39;s big-screen style landscapes and eerie black surrounds, reminiscent of a darkened movie theater, set the scene for The Watertower, his ninth published book.Grade 3 Up?In this "Twilight Zone"-type picture book for older children, the menace lurks behind the innocuous words, and in what the illustrations don't show. The plot is deceptively flat: two boys go swimming in a decrepit watertower. When Bubba is reluctant to return to his heavy-handed mother after he has lost his shorts (apparently blown off the tower), Spike runs back to sneak another pair out to him. Bubba has been afraid of the water, but when Spike returns, his friend is climbing out of the tank and boasting about his swim, which Spike finds "not like Bubba." That's the story. The pictures, in a highly realistic style, show the shabby outback town dominated by the eye-shaped tank at one end and a huge antenna dish at the other. The cryptic symbol printed on the tank, a segmented incomplete circle, appears repeatedly on various objects: caps, machinery, and, in the final frame, on Bubba's hand. Eyes are important: the townsfolk's eyes turn up to the watertower expectantly, and Bubba's eyes are different after that swim. The page layout, oriented longitudinally, shifts again at the critical pages (through a framing device that is part of the puzzle) so that readers unconsciously rotate the book and end by reading it backwards. What mysterious change has occurred? Many debates and a close examination of the words and pictures will inevitably follow any causal reading of this true picture book?a union in which text and illustrations work inseparably to create a strange but compelling whole.?Patricia Lothrop-Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Outside History: Selected Poems, 1980-1990</h2><p><p><strong>An essential volume by one of our most esteemed poets.</strong></p> "[Boland is] an original, dazzlingly gifted writer....

Two women, totally unalike in background, personality and social class, are brought together by a shared fascination with the philosophical movement founded by the late Anna Granite (read Ayn Rand). Justine is a chic journalist who wants to write an article about the followers of Granite's philosophy, Definitism. Dorothy is an obese, nocturnal word processor who answers Justine's advertisement in Manhattan Thing and offers to be interviewed about her involvement with the Definitists. As the two women come to know each other, their dismal life experiences gradually emerge, and their present circumstances are seen as a repetition of past connections and betrayals. This is a hard, edgy book, and Gaitskill's energy and flashy intelligence notwithstanding, the perhaps deliberate lack of polish ultimately detracts. The novel's raw, unsparing view is like that of certain contemporary paintings, and there are extraordinary moments of deeply examined female sexuality where Gaitskill is at her most original. But an underdeveloped and fragmented style has not served her well with the narrative and structural demands here. Thus this distinctive novel falls short of its potential.

His first book, <i>Returning to Silence, </i> emphasized the need to return to our original, enlightened state of being, and became one of the classics of Zen in America. In <i>You Have to Say Something, </i> selections from his talks have been collected to address another key theme of Katagiri's teaching: that of bringing Zen insight to bear on our everyday experience. "To live life fully," Katagiri says, "means to take care of your life day by day, moment to moment, right here, right now." To do this, he teaches, we must plunge into our life completely, bringing to it the same wholeheartedness that is required in Zen meditation. When we approach life in this way, every activity&#x2014;everything we do, everything we say&#x2014;becomes an opportunity for manifesting our own innate wisdom. With extraordinary freshness and immediacy, Katagiri shows the reader how this wisdom not only enlivens our spiritual practice but can help make our life a rich, seamless whole.</p><p>Born in Osaka, Japan, in 1928, Dainin Katagiri was trained traditionally as a Zen teacher. He first came to the United States in 1963, to help with a Soto Zen Temple in Los Angeles. He later joined Shunryu Suzuki Roshi at the San Francisco Zen Center and taught there until Suzuki Roshi&#x2019;s death in 1971. He was then invited to form a new Zen center in Minneapolis, which, in addition to a monastery in the countryside of Minnesota, he oversaw until his death in 1990. He left behind a legacy of recorded teachings and twelve Dharma heirs. Katagiri is the author of several books, including <i>Returning to Silence</i> and <i>You Have to Say Something.</i>"You are Buddha, so learn to behave as a Buddha. Go beyond your self-centered ideas, your likes and dislikes." So begins a section in the essay, "Bodhi Mind," by the influential American Zen master Katagiri. Though these instructions sound easy, these collected essays are not for the beginner. The anthology's no-nonsense style and approach hit the reader like a slap with a stick from a Zen meditation teacher correcting one's posture in Zen meditation. While erudite and informed, these essays lack any humor and warmth that might entice the novice to sample the delights of Zen even further. The lessons stare up at you like figures from a spreadsheet, demanding a reader's uncritical acceptance. The essays read like the thoughts of a Zen bureaucrat rather than a lover of this rich and profound path to self-knowledge. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Real Children</h2><p><p>It's 2015, and Patricia Cowan is very old.

Less confused. Very confused.&#x201d; That last was written frequently, sometimes abbreviated by the nurses to just &#x201c;VC,&#x201d; which made her smile, as if she were sufficiently confused to be given a medal for it. Her name was on the notes too&#x2014;just her first name, Patricia, as if in old age she were demoted to childhood, and denied both the dignity of surname and title and the familiarity of the form of her name she preferred. The notes reminded her of a school report with the little boxes and fixed categories into which it was so difficult to express the real complexity of any situation. &#x201c;Spelling atrocious.&#x201d; &#x201c;Needs to pay attention.&#x201d; &#x201c;Confused today.&#x201d; They seemed remote and Olympian and impossible to appeal. &#x201c;But Miss!&#x201d; the kids would say in more recent years. She would never have dared when she was in school, and neither would the obedient girls of her first years of teaching. &#x201c;But Miss!&#x201d; was a product of their growing confidence, trickle-down feminism, and she welcomed it even as it made her daily work harder. She wanted to say it now herself to the nurses who added to her notes: &#x201c;But Miss! I&#x2019;m only a little confused today!&#x201d; <br>The notes hung clipped to the end of her bed. They listed her medication, the stuff for her heart she had been taking for years since the first attack. She was grateful that they remembered it for her now, the abrupt Latin syllables. She liked to check the notes from time to time, even though the staff discouraged it if they caught her at it. The notes had the date, which otherwise was hard to remember, and even the day of the week, which she so easily lost track of here, where all days were alike. She could even forget what time of year it was, going out so seldom, which she would have thought impossible. Not knowing the season really was a sign of severe confusion. <br>Sometimes, especially at first, she looked at the notes to see how confused she appeared to them, but often lately she forgot, and then forgot what she had forgotten to do among the constant morass of things she needed to keep track of and the endless muddle of notes reminding herself of what she had meant to do. She had found a list once that began &#x201c;Make list.&#x201d; VC, the attendants would have written if they had seen it; but that was long before the dementia began, when she had been still quite young, although she had not thought so at the time. She had never felt older than those years when the children were small and so demanding of her attention. She had felt it a new lease on youth when they were grown and gone, and the constant drain on her time and caring was relieved. Not that she had ever stopped caring. Even now when she saw their faces, impossibly middle-aged, she felt that same burden of unconditional loving tugging at her, their needs and problems, and her inability to keep them safe and give them what they wanted. <br>It was when she thought of her children that she was most truly confused. Sometimes she knew with solid certainty that she had four children, and five more stillbirths: nine times giving birth in floods of blood and pain, and of those, four surviving. At other times she knew equally well that she had two children, both born by caesarean section late in her life after she had given up hope. Two children of her body, and another, a stepchild, dearest of them all. When any of them visited she knew them, knew how many of them there were, and the other knowledge felt like a dream. She couldn&#x2019;t understand how she could be so muddled. If she saw Philip she knew he was one of her three children, yet if she saw Cathy she knew she was one of her four children. She recognized them and felt that mother&#x2019;s ache. She was not yet as confused as her own mother had been at last when she had not known her, had wept and fled from her and accused her of terrible crimes. She knew that time would come, when her children and grandchildren would be strangers. She had watched her mother&#x2019;s decline and knew what lay ahead. In her constant struggle to keep track of her glasses and her hearing aid and her book it was this that she dreaded, the day when they came and she did not know them, when she would respond to Sammy politely as to a stranger, or worse, in horror as to an enemy. <br>She was glad for their sake that they didn&#x2019;t have to witness it every day, as she had done. She was glad they had found her this nursing home, even if it seemed to shift around her from day to day, abruptly thrusting out new wings or folding up on itself to make a wall where yesterday there had been a corridor. She knew there was a lift, and yet when the nurses told her that was nonsense she took the stairlift as docilely as she could. She remembered her mother struggling and fighting and insisting, and let it go. When the lift was there again she wanted to tell the nurse in triumph that she had been right, but it was a different nurse. And what was more likely, after all&#x2014;that it was the dementia (&#x201c;VC&#x201d;), or that place kept changing? They were gentle and well-meaning, she wasn&#x2019;t going to ascribe their actions to malice as her mother had so easily ascribed everything. Still, if she was going to forget some things and remember others, why couldn&#x2019;t she forget the anguish of her mother&#x2019;s long degeneration and remember where she had put down her hearing aids? <br>Two of the nurses were taking her down to the podiatrist one day&#x2014;she was so frail now that she needed one on each side to help her shuffle down the corridor. They stood waiting for the elusive lift, which appeared to be back in existence today. The wall by the lift was painted an institutional green, like many of the schools where she had taught. It was a color nobody chose for their home, but which any committee thought appropriate for a school or a hospital or a nursing home. Hanging on the wall was a reproduction of a painting, a field of poppies. It wasn&#x2019;t Monet as she had thought on earlier casual glances; it was one of the Second Impressionist school of the Seventies. &#x201c;Pamela Corey,&#x201d; she said, remembering. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the male nurse said, patronizing as ever. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s David Hockney. Corey painted the picture of the ruins of Miami we have in the little day room.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I taught her,&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;No, did you?&#x201d; the female nurse asked. &#x201c;Fancy having taught somebody famous like that, helped somebody become a real artist.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I taught her English, not art,&#x201d; Pat said, as the lift came and they all three went in. &#x201c;I do remember encouraging her to go on to the Royal Academy.&#x201d; Pamela Corey had been thin and passionate in the sixth form, and torn between Oxford and painting. She remembered talking to her about safe and unsafe choices, and what one might regret. <br>&#x201c;Somebody famous,&#x201d; the female nurse repeated, breaking her train of thought. <br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t famous then,&#x201d; Pat said. &#x201c;Nobody is. You never know until too late. They&#x2019;re just people like everyone else. Anyone you know might become famous. Or not. You don&#x2019;t know which ones will make a difference or if any of them will. You might become famous yourself. You might change the world.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bit late for that now,&#x201d; the nurse said, laughing that little deprecating laugh that Pat always hated to hear other women use, the laugh that diminished possibilities. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too late. You&#x2019;d be amazed how much I&#x2019;ve done since I was your age, how much difference I&#x2019;ve made. You can do whatever you want to, make yourself whatever you want to be.&#x201d; <br>The nurse recoiled a little from her vehemence. &#x201c;Calm down now, Patricia,&#x201d; the male nurse said on her other side. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re scaring poor Nasreen.&#x201d; <br>She grimaced. Men always diminished her that way, and what she had been saying had been important. She turned back to the female nurse, but they were out of the lift and in a corridor she&#x2019;d never seen before, a corridor with heather-twill carpet, and though she had been sure they were going to the podiatrist it was an opthalmologist who was waiting in the sunny little room. <i>Confused,</i> she thought. Confused again, and maybe she really was scaring the nurses. Her mother had scared her. She hated to close herself back in the box of being a good girl, to appease, to smile, to let go of the fierce caring that had been so much a part of who she was. But she didn&#x2019;t want to terrify people either. <br>Later, back in her bedroom with a prescription for new reading glasses that the nurse had taken away safely, she tried to remember what she had been thinking about Pamela. Follow your heart, she had said, or perhaps follow your art. Of course Pamela hadn&#x2019;t been famous then, and there had been nothing to mark her as destined for fame. She&#x2019;d been just another girl, one of the hundreds or thousands of girls she had taught. Towards the end there had been boys too, after they went comprehensive, but it was the girls she especially remembered. Men had enough already; women were socialized not to put themselves first. She certainly had been. It was women who needed more of a hand making choices. <br>She had made choices. Thinking about that she felt the strange doubling, the contradictory memories, as if she had two histories that both led her to this point, this nursing home. She was confused, there was no question about that. She had lived a long life. They asked her how old she was and she said she was nearly ninety, because she couldn&#x2019;t remember whether she was eighty-eight or eighty-nine, and she couldn&#x2019;t remember if it was 2014 or 2015 either. She kept finding out and it kept slipping away. She was born in 1926, the year of the General Strike; she held on to that. That wasn&#x2019;t doubled. Her memories of childhood were solitary and fixed, clear and single as slides thrown on a screen. It must have happened later, whatever it was that caused it. At Oxford? After? There were no slides any more. Her grandchildren showed her photographs on their phones. They lived in a different world from the world where she had grown up. <br>A different world. She considered that for a moment. She had never cared for science fiction, though she had friends who did. She had read a children&#x2019;s book to the class once, Penelope Farmer&#x2019;s <i>Charlotte Sometimes,</i> about a girl in boarding school who woke up each day in a different time, forty years behind, changing places with another girl. She remembered they did each other&#x2019;s homework, which worked well enough except when it came to memorizing poetry. She had been forced to memorize just such reams of poetry by her mother, which had come in handy later. She was never at a loss for a quotation. She had probably been accepted into Oxford on her ability to quote, though of course it was the war, and the lack of young men had made it easier for women. <br>She had been to Oxford. Her memories there were not confusingly doubled. Tolkien had taught her Old English. She remembered him declaiming <i>Beowulf</i> at nine o&#x2019;clock on a Monday morning, coming into the room and putting the book down with a bang and turning to them all: &#x201c;Hwaet!&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t been famous then, either. It was years before <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and all the fuss. Later people had been so excited when she told them she had known him. You can never tell who&#x2019;s going to be famous. And at Oxford, as Margaret Drabble had written, everyone had the excitement of thinking they might be going to be someone famous. She had never imagined that she would be. But she had wondered about her friends, and certainly Mark. Poor Mark. <br>The indisputable fact was: she was confused. She lost track of her thoughts. She had difficulty remembering things. People told her things and she heard them and reacted and then forgot all about them. She had forgotten that Bethany had been signed by a record label. That she was just as delighted the second time Bethany told her didn&#x2019;t matter. Bethany had been crushed that she had forgotten. Worse, she had forgotten, unforgivably, that Jamie had been killed. She knew that Cathy was wounded that she could have forgotten, even though she had said that she wished she could forget herself. Cathy was so easily hurt, and she wouldn&#x2019;t have hurt her for anything, especially after such a loss, but she had, unthinkingly, because her brain wouldn&#x2019;t hold the memory. How much else had she forgotten and then not even remembered that she had forgotten? <br>Her brain couldn&#x2019;t be trusted. Now she imagined that she was living in two different realities, drifting between them; but it must be her brain that was at fault, like a computer with a virus that made some sectors inaccessible and others impossible to write to. That had been Rhodri&#x2019;s metaphor. Rhodri was one of the few people who would talk to her about her dementia as a problem, a problem with potential fixes and workarounds. She hadn&#x2019;t seen him for too long. Perhaps he was busy. Or perhaps she had been in the other world, the world where he didn&#x2019;t exist. <br>She picked up a book. She had given up on trying to read new books, though it broke her heart. She couldn&#x2019;t find where she had put them down and she couldn&#x2019;t remember what she had read so far. She could still re-read old books like old friends, though she knew that too would go; before the end her mother had forgotten how to read. For now, while she could, she read a lot of poetry, a lot of classics. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s <i>Cranford</i> came to her hand now, and she opened it at random to read about Miss Matty and her financial difficulties back in the time of King William. &#x201c;The last gigot in England had been seen in Cranford, and seen without a smile.&#x201d; <br>After a while she let the book drop. It had grown dark outside, and she got up and tottered over to draw the curtains. She made her way carefully, hanging onto the bed and then the wall. They didn&#x2019;t like her to do it without the quad cane but she was safe enough, there wasn&#x2019;t room to fall. Though she had fallen once on her way to the toilet and forgotten that she had a button to call for help. The curtains were navy blue, although she was quite sure there had been a pale green blind the last time. She leaned on the window sill, looking out at the bare branches of a sycamore moving in the breeze. The moon was half-obscured by a thin veil of cloud. Where was this place? Up on the moor? Or was it somewhere along the canal? There might be birds in the branches in the morning. She must remember to come and look. She had her binoculars somewhere. She remembered insisting on holding on to them and Philip saying gently that she wouldn&#x2019;t have any use for them in the nursing home and Jinny saying in her gruff way that she might as well bring them if she wanted them. They must be here somewhere, unless that was in the other world. It would be very unfair if the binoculars were in one world and the tree were in the other. <br>If there were two worlds. <br>If there were two worlds, then what caused her to slide between them? They weren&#x2019;t two times as they were for Charlotte. It was the same year, whichever year it was. It was just that things were different, things that shouldn&#x2019;t have been different. She had four children, or three. There was a lift in the nursing home, or there was only a stairlift. She could remember things that couldn&#x2019;t simultaneously be true. She remembered Kennedy being assassinated and she remembered him declining to run again after the Cuban missile exchange. They couldn&#x2019;t both have happened, yet she remembered them both happening. Had she made a choice that could have gone two ways and thereafter had two lives? Two lives that both began in Twickenham in 1926 and both ended here in this nursing home in 2014 or 2015, whichever it was? <br>She shuffled back and looked at her notes, clipped to the end of the bed. It was February 5th 2015, and she was VC. That was definite, and good to know. She sat down but did not take up the book. It woul...</p><h2>A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion</h2><p>A strange and repugnant mystery of the twentieth century is the durability of the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>, a clumsy forgery purporting to be evidence of the supposed Jewish plot to rule the world.

He introduced himself and said: &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve known you for years. Everyone says you were beautiful when you were young, but I want to tell you I think you&#x2019;re more beautiful now than then. Rather than your face as a young woman, I prefer your face as it is now. Ravaged.&#x2019; <br>&nbsp;<br>I often think of the image only I can see now, and of which I&#x2019;ve never spoken. It&#x2019;s always there, in the same silence, amazing. It&#x2019;s the only image of myself I like, the only one in which I recognize myself, in which I delight. <br>&nbsp;<br>Very early in my life it was too late. It was already too late when I was eighteen. Between eighteen and twenty-five my face took off in a new direction. I grew old at eighteen. I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s the same for everyone. I&#x2019;ve never asked. But I believe I&#x2019;ve heard of the way time can suddenly accelerate on people when they&#x2019;re going through even the most youthful and highly esteemed stages of life. My ageing was very sudden. I saw it spread over my features one by one, changing the relationship between them, making the eyes larger, the expression sadder, the mouth more final, leaving great creases in the forehead. But instead of being dismayed I watched this process with the same sort of interest Imight have taken in the reading of a book. And I knew I was right, that one day it would slow down and take its normal course. The people who knew me at seventeen, when I went to France, were surprised when they saw me again two years later, at nineteen. And I&#x2019;ve kept it ever since, the new face I had then. It has been my face. It&#x2019;s got older still, of course, but less, comparatively, than it would otherwise have done. It&#x2019;s scored with deep, dry wrinkles, the skin is cracked. But my face hasn&#x2019;t collapsed, as some with fine features have done. It&#x2019;s kept the same contours, but its substance has been laid waste. I have a face laid waste.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, I&#x2019;m fifteen and a half.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s on a ferry crossing the Mekong river.<br>&nbsp;<br>The image lasts all the way across.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m fifteen and a half, there are no seasons in that part of the world,we have just the one season, hot, monotonous,we&#x2019;re in the long hot girdle of the earth, with no spring, no renewal. <br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m at a state boarding school in Saigon. I eat and sleep there, but I go to classes at the French high school. My mother&#x2019;s a teacher and wants her girl to have a secondary education. &#x2018;You have to go to high school.&#x2019; What was enough for her is not enough for her daughter. High school and then a good degree in mathematics. That was what had been dinned into me ever since I started school. It never crossedmymind I might escape the mathematics degree, I was glad to give her that hope. Every day I saw her planning her own and her children&#x2019;s future. There came a time when she couldn&#x2019;t plan anything very grand for her sons any more, so she planned other futures, makeshift ones, but they too served their purpose, they blocked in the time that lay ahead. I remember my younger brother&#x2019;s courses in book-keeping. From the Universal Correspondence School &#x2013; every year, every level. You have to catch up, my mother used to say. It would last for three days, never four. Never.We&#x2019;d drop the Universal School whenever my mother was posted to another place. And begin again in the next. My mother kept it up for ten years. It wasn&#x2019;t any good. My younger brother became an accountant&#x2019;s clerk in Saigon. There was no technical school in the colonies; we owed my elder brother&#x2019;s departure for France to that. He stayed in France for several years to study at the technical school. But he didn&#x2019;t keep it up. My mother must have known. But she had no choice, he had to be got away from the other two children.<br>&nbsp;<br>For several years he was no longer part of the family. It was while he was away that my mother bought the land, the concession. A terrible business, but for us, the children who were left, not so terrible as the presence of the killer would have been, the child-killer of the night, of the night of the hunter.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve often been told it was because of spending all one&#x2019;s childhood in too strong a sun. But I&#x2019;ve never believed it. I&#x2019;ve also been told it was because being poor made us brood. But no, that wasn&#x2019;t it. Children like little old men because of chronic hunger, yes. But us, no, we weren&#x2019;t hungry. We were white children, we were ashamed, we sold our furniture but we weren&#x2019;t hungry, we had a houseboy and we ate. Sometimes, admittedly, we ate garbage, storks, baby crocodiles, but the garbage was cooked and served by a houseboy, and sometimes we refused it, too, we indulged in the luxury of declining to eat. No, something occurred when I was eighteen to make this face happen. It must have been at night. I was afraid of myself, afraid of God. In the daylight I was less afraid, and death seemed less important. But it haunted me all the time. I wanted to kill &#x2013; my older brother, I wanted to kill him, to get the better of him for once, just once, and see him die. I wanted to do it to remove from my mother&#x2019;s sight the object of her love, that son of hers, to punish her for loving him so much, so badly, and above all &#x2013; as I told myself, too &#x2013; to save my younger brother, my younger brother, my child, save him from the living life of that elder brother superimposed on his own, from that black veil over the light, from the law which was decreed and represented by the elder brother, a human being, and yet which was an animal law, filling every moment of every day of the younger brother&#x2019;s life with fear, a fear that one day reached his heart and killed him.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve written a good deal about the members of my family, but then they were still alive, my mother and my brothers. And I skirted around them, skirted around all these things without really tackling them.<br>&nbsp;<br>The story of my life doesn&#x2019;t exist. Does not exist. There&#x2019;s never any centre to it. No path, no line. There are great spaces where you pretend there used to be someone, but it&#x2019;s not true, there was no one. The story of one small part of my youth I&#x2019;ve already written, more or less &#x2013; I mean, enough to give a glimpse of it. Of this part, I mean, the part about the crossing of the river. What I&#x2019;m doing now is both different and the same. Before, I spoke of clear periods, those on which the light fell. Now I&#x2019;m talking about the hidden stretches of that same youth, of certain facts, feelings, events that I buried. I started to write in surroundings that drove me to reticence. Writing, for those people, was still something moral. Nowadays it often seems writing is nothing at all. Sometimes I realize that if writing isn&#x2019;t, all things, all contraries confounded, a quest for vanity and void, it&#x2019;s nothing. That if it&#x2019;s not, each time, all things confounded into one through some inexpressible essence, then writing is nothing but advertisement. But usually I have no opinion, I can see that all options are open now, that there seem to be no more barriers, that writing seems at a loss for somewhere to hide, to be written, to be read. That its basic unseemliness is no longer accepted. But at that point I stop thinking about it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now I see that when I was very young, eighteen, fifteen, I already had a face that foretold the one I acquired through drink in middle age. Drink accomplished what God did not. It also served to kill me; to kill. I acquired that drinker&#x2019;s face before I drank. Drink only confirmed it. The space for it existed in me. I knew it the same as other people, but, strangely, in advance. Just as the space existed in me for desire. At the age of fifteen I had the face of pleasure, and yet I had no knowledge of pleasure. There was no mistaking that face. Evenmy mother must have seen it. My brothers did. That was how everything started for me &#x2013; with that flagrant, exhausted face, those rings round the eyes, in advance of time and experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m fifteen and a half. Crossing the river. Going back to Saigon I feel I&#x2019;m going on a journey, especially when I take the bus, and this morning I&#x2019;ve taken the bus from Sadec, where my mother&#x2019;s the head-mistress of the girls&#x2019; school. It&#x2019;s the end of some school vacation, I forget which. I&#x2019;ve spent it in the little house provided with my mother&#x2019;s job. And today I&#x2019;m going back to Saigon, to the boarding school. The native bus left from the market place in Sadec. As usual my mother came to see me off, and put me in the care of the driver. She always puts me in the care of the Saigon bus drivers, in case there&#x2019;s an accident, or a fire, or a rape, or an attack by pirates, or a fatal mishap on the ferry. As usual the driver had me sit near him in the front, in the section reserved for white passengers. <br>&nbsp;<br>I think it was during this journey that the image became detached, removed from all the rest. It might have existed, a photograph might have been taken, just like any other, somewhere else, in other circumstances. But it wasn&#x2019;t. The subject was too slight. Who would have thought of such a thing? The photograph could only have been taken if someone could have known in advance how important it was to be in my life, that event, that crossing of the river. But, while it was happening, no one even knew of its existence. Except God. And that&#x2019;s why &#x2013; it couldn&#x2019;t have been otherwise &#x2013; the image doesn&#x2019;t exist. It was omitted. Forgotten. It never was detached or removed from all the rest. And it&#x2019;s to this, this failure to have been created, that the image owes its virtue: the virtue of representing, of being the creator of, an absolute.<br>&nbsp;<br>So it&#x2019;s during the crossing of a branch of the Mekong, on the ferry that plies between Vinh Long and Sadec in the great plain of mud and rice in southern Cochin-China. The Plain of the Birds.<br>&nbsp;<br>I get off the bus. I go over to the rails. I look at the river. My mother sometimes tells me that never in my whole life shall I ever again see rivers as beautiful and big and wild as these, the Mekong and its tributaries going down to the sea, the great regions of water soon to disappear into the caves of ocean. In the surrounding flatness stretching as far as the eye can see, the rivers flow as fast as if the earth sloped downwards.<br>&nbsp;<br>I always get off the bus when we reach the ferry, even at night, because I&#x2019;m always afraid, afraid the cables might break and we might be swept out to sea. In the terrible current I watch my last moments. The current&#x2019;s so strong it could carry everything away &#x2013; rocks, a cathedral, a city. There&#x2019;s a storm blowing inside the water. A wind raging. <br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m wearing a dress of real silk, but it&#x2019;s threadbare, almost transparent. It used to belong to my mother. One day she decided the colour was too bright for her and she gave it to me. It&#x2019;s a sleeveless dress with a very low neck. It&#x2019;s the sepia colour real silk takes on with wear. It&#x2019;s a dress I remember. I think it suits me. I&#x2019;m wearing a leather belt with it, perhaps a belt belonging to one of my brothers. I can&#x2019;t remember the shoes I used to wear in those days, only certain dresses. Most of the time I wore canvas sandals, no stockings. I&#x2019;m speaking of the time before the high school in Saigon. Since then, of course, I&#x2019;ve always worn shoes. This particular day I must be wearing the famous pair of gold lame� high heels. I can&#x2019;t see any others I could have been wearing, so I&#x2019;m wearing them. Bargains, final reductions bought for me by my mother. I&#x2019;m wearing these gold lame� shoes to school. Going to school in evening shoes decorated with little <i>diamante� </i>flowers. I insist on wearing them. I don&#x2019;t like myself in any others, and to this day I still like myself in them. These high heels are the first in my life, they&#x2019;re beautiful, they&#x2019;ve eclipsed all the shoes that went before, the flat ones, for playing and running about, made of white canvas.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s not the shoes, though, that make the girl look so strangely, so weirdly dressed. No, it&#x2019;s the fact that she&#x2019;s wearing a man&#x2019;s flat-brimmed hat, a brownish-pink fedora with a broad black ribbon.<br>&nbsp;<br>The crucial ambiguity of the image lies in the hat.</p><h2>Transportation Security (Butterworth-Heinemann Homeland Security)</h2><p>Our worldwide mobility based economy is being impacted (6% of GDP) due to insecure transportation systems.

Bernstein on <em>Enough </em></strong><br> William Bernstein, Ph.D., M.D. is the critically acclaimed author, financial theorist and historian whose books include <em>A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World</em>, <em>The Birth of Plenty</em>, <em>The Four Pillars of Investing</em>, and <em>The Intelligent Asset Allocator</em>. Bernstein is frequently quoted in national publications, including <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Barron's</em>, <em>Money</em>, and <em>Forbes</em>. <p></p> <p> If you are wondering about the cause of the current market crisis, then you haven't been reading enough of Jack Bogle.</p> <p>Because he certainly knows not only where, but why and how. For decades Jack has been communicating his disquiet in previous books, speeches, and public testimony. Years from now, when historians and investors dissect the economic and market meltdowns of 2008, they'll consult this slim, well-written volume.</p> <p>In order to understand the intellectual and moral platform from which he surveys the economic wreckage, you need to know a little of his story. Bogle founded one of the world's great investment companies, the Vanguard Group. Most men in his situation would have levered such success into a multi-billion-dollar net worth; instead, he "mutualized" Vanguard, converting it, in effect, into a nonprofit organization whose only goal was to benefit its fund holders. From an ethical perspective, Vanguard is the only "investment company" worthy of that name. (As opposed to most financial firms, which are in fact "marketing companies" whose main purpose is to milk unwitting investors of fees and commissions.)</p> <p>The answer to the conundrum of 2008 lies in the book&#x2019;s title, "Enough," which is the punch line from a delightful Kurt Vonnegut/Joseph Heller story. Simply put, our nation has been suffering from decades of unchecked financial excess, for which we are now paying the piper: excess in investment company fees; excess in financial speculation masquerading as diversification and innovation; excess in the salaries of top executives; excess in salesmanship; and most importantly, excess in the role played by the financial industry in our national economy and national life.</p> <p>Each of these excesses gets its own chapter, and each one is a tightly written gem. Chapters 2 and 3, which dissect out the frenzy of derivatives, structured vehicles, and layers of intermediation behind the recent collapse, alone justify the book's purchase price.</p> <p>As Bogle states in the book's beginning, in the spring of 2007 the financial services sector--which, after all, produces nothing of substantive value--accounted for one-third of the earnings of the S&amp;P 500. By the time you read this, this outsized influence will have shrunken drastically. Let <em>Enough</em> be your welcome to the brave new world; it will satisfy your curiosity, give you a sense of moral balance in this most materialistic of ages, and even plump up your investment portfolio.</p> <p><em>--William J.

Inspired in large measure by the hundreds of lectures Bogle has delivered to professional groups and college students in recent years, this book will help you discover what it really means to have "enough" and how close you are to really having it.<p>We live during a time where there seems to be no limit to what "enough" entails. CEOs--even those of failing corporations--pull down huge paychecks and hedge fund managers can enjoy billion-dollar paydays. These excesses are only the most obvious examples of the gross excesses that have overwhelmed our financial system, precipitating the crisis we now face. </p><p>These excesses extend far beyond the financial markets. Not knowing what is "enough" also undermines our business and professional values, and often leads us astray when attempting to make important personal decisions about our investments and indeed about our own lives. </p><p>Throughout his legendary career, John C. Bogle--founder of the Vanguard Mutual Fund Group and creator of the first index mutual fund--has helped investors build wealth the right way and led a tireless campaign to restore common sense to the investment world. Along the way, he's seen how destructive an obsession with financial success can be. Now, with Enough., he puts this dilemma in perspective. </p><p>Inspired in large measure by the hundreds of lectures Bogle has delivered to professional groups and college students in recent years, Enough. seeks, paraphrasing Kurt Vonnegut, "to poison our minds with a little humanity." Bogle considers what "enough" actually means as it relates to money, business, and life. The world of finance, he argues, is marked by too much cost, and not enough value; too much speculation, and not enough investment; too much complexity, and not enough simplicity. Similarly, our business world is focused too much on counting and salesmanship, and not enough on trust and stewardship; and our society at large is too obsessed with charisma and wealth, and not enough with character and wisdom. </p><p>Bogle also considers what "enough" means for him personally, and offers his thoughts on how--in a world increasingly focused on status and score-keeping--you can find your way and take comfort in the knowledge that you can indeed have "enough." </p><p>Written in a straightforward and accessible style, Enough. inspires and enlightens in equal measure. Bogle offers his unparalleled insights on money, on the values we should emulate in our business and professional callings, and on what we should consider as the true treasures in our lives.

The nearly 200 documents-dossiers, police reports, private letters, secret transcripts, and more-expose the hidden inner workings of the Communist Party and the dark inhumanity of the purge process.</p><p>J. Arch Getty is professor of modern Russian history at the University of California, Riverside. Oleg V. Naumov is deputy director of the Moscow archive RGASPI.This documentary collection, continuing Yale's pioneering Annals of Communism series, tackles questions surrounding the paroxysm of the purges in 1937^-38. One thing Stalin had was a long memory, and the hitherto mysterious Riutin Platform (the contents here at last seeing the light) must have rankled him. The platform was a 1932 call by Bolshevik veterans to remove him. The course culminating in the extirpation of all opposition was complex, and the authors' commentary underscores that a politics of sorts continued up to the point when full-blown terror was unleashed, a politics that pitted the central apparatus of Stalin and his associates in Moscow against the regional party bosses. The authors track one such Stalinist's fate in detail, as they do that of Bukharin, Stalin's opponent in the 1920s. The 200 documents here will astonish anyone familiar with the era, yet it is a specialized tome whose public library appeal could be checked against the circulation stats for the indubitably popular <i>Who Killed Kirov?</i> by Amy Knight. <i>IGilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Treasures, A Reading/Language Arts Program, Grade 1, Book 3 Student Edition (ELEMENTARY READING TREASURES)</h2><p>Engaging Student Books Reinforce Phonics and Word Instruction.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Criticizing Photographs: An Introduction to Understanding Images</h2><p>This brief text is designed to help both beginning and advanced students of photography better develop and articulate thoughtful criticism.

That&#x2019;s because when she first saw me earlier today, she grabbed me in a huge, tearful hug and whispered in my ear: &#x201c;You are not responsible for this, Carver Briggs. God knows it and so do I.&#x201d; And Nana Betsy tends to say what she thinks. So there&#x2019;s that.<br><br>If you ask Eli Bauer&#x2019;s parents, Dr. Pierce Bauer and Dr. Melissa Rubin-�Bauer, I expect they&#x2019;d say maybe. When I saw them today, they each looked me in the eyes and shook my hand. In their faces, I saw more bereavement than anger. I sensed their desolation in the weakness of their handshakes. And I&#x2019;m guessing part of their fatigue was over whether to hold me accountable in some way for their loss. So they go down as a maybe. Their daughter, Adair? Eli&#x2019;s twin? We used to be friends. Not like Eli and I were, but friends. I&#x2019;d say she&#x2019;s a &#x201c;definitely&#x201d; from the way she glowers at me as if she wishes I&#x2019;d been in the car too. She was doing just that a few minutes ago, while talking with some of our classmates attending the funeral.<br><br>Then there&#x2019;s Judge Frederick Douglass Edwards and his ex-�wife, Cynthia Edwards. If you ask them if I killed their son, Thurgood Marshall &#x201c;Mars&#x201d; Edwards, I expect you&#x2019;d hear a firm &#x201c;probably.&#x201d; When I saw Judge Edwards today, he towered over me, immaculately dressed as always. Neither of us spoke for a while. The air between us felt hard and rough as stone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you, sir,&#x201d; I said finally, and extended my sweating hand.<br><br>&#x201c;None of this is good,&#x201d; he said in his kingly voice, jaw muscles clenching, looking above me. Beyond me. As though he thought if he could persuade himself of my insignificance, he could persuade himself that I had nothing to do with his son&#x2019;s death. He shook my hand like it was both his duty and his only way of hurting me.<br><br>Then there&#x2019;s me. I would tell you that I definitely killed my three best friends.<br><br>Not on purpose. I&#x2019;m pretty sure no one thinks I did it on purpose; that I slipped under their car in the dead of night and severed the brake lines. No, here&#x2019;s the cruel irony for the writer I am: I wrote them out of existence. Where are you guys? Text me back. Not a particularly good or creative text message. But they found Mars&#x2019;s phone (Mars was driving) with a half-�composed text responding to me, just as I requested. It looks like that was what he was working on when he slammed into the rear of a stopped semi on the highway at almost seventy miles per hour. The car went under the trailer, shearing off the top.<br><br>Am I certain that it was my text message that set into motion the chain of events that culminated in my friends&#x2019; deaths? No. But I&#x2019;m sure enough.<br><br>I&#x2019;m numb. Blank. Not yet in the throes of the blazing, ringing pain I&#x2019;m certain waits for me in the unrolling days ahead. It&#x2019;s like once when I was chopping onions to help my mom in the kitchen. The knife slipped and I sliced open my hand. There was this pause in my brain as if my body needed to figure out it had been cut. I knew two things right then: (1) I felt only a quick strike and a dull throbbing. But the pain was coming. Oh, was it coming. And (2) I knew that in a second or two, I was about to start raining blood all over my mom&#x2019;s favorite bamboo cutting board (yes, people can form deep emotional attachments to cutting boards; no, I don&#x2019;t get it so don&#x2019;t ask).<br><br>So I sit at Blake Lloyd&#x2019;s funeral and wait for the pain.

Much of what had been learned over thirty years of scientific medical study was so distorted or suppressed that no objective overview was available to the general reader - except for this book. LSD Psychotherapy is a complete account of a remarkable chapter in the ever-continuing inquiry into our transpersonal nature and origins. The controlled studies described in this book reveal exciting and challenging data about the nature of human consciousness, perception, and reality itself. Drawing on this work Dr. Stanislav Grof outlines a new cartography of the human mind, one which accounts for experiences such as shamanic trance, near-death experiences and altered states of consciousness. This vision is also the foundation for Dr. Grof's revolutionary new Holotropic Breathwork&#x2122; techniques. This book is also a visual feast, with numerous color drawings and paintings created by research participants (see featured artist Sherana Harriette Frances' book Drawing It Out: Befriending the Unconscious). Many of these depict archetypal images from the collective human consciousness, which form a powerful addition to the text. LSD Psychotherapy is a valuable source of information for those who are involved with LSD in any way, as parents, teachers, researchers, legislators, or students of the human psyche. The approach to healing described in this book is inspired by the eternal desire of humankind for wholeness and an enduring grasp of reality.</p><p>The sensationalism surrounding the widespread use of LSD in the late 60&#39;s and the subsequent legislative overkill virtually ended psychotherapeutic LSD research.

Judah argues that Putinism has brought economic growth to Russia but also weaker institutions, and this contradiction leads to instability. The author explores both Putin&#x2019;s successes and his failed promises, taking into account the impact of a new middle class and a new generation, the Internet, social activism, and globalization on the president&#x2019;s impending leadership crisis. Can Russia avoid the crisis of Putinism?

With unusual juxtapositions of object and metaphor, a bouquet of language-play, and deeply resonant rhythms, C�saire considered this work a "break into the forbidden," at once a cry of rebellion and a celebration of black identity.<br><br>More praise:<br><br>"The greatest living poet in the French language."--<i>American Book Review</i><br><br>"Martinique poet Aime Cesaire is one of the few pure surrealists alive today. By this I mean that his work has never compromised its wild universe of double meanings, stretched syntax, and unexpected imagery. This long poem was written at the end of World War II and became an anthem for many blacks around the world. Eshleman and Smith have revised their original 1983 translations and given it additional power by presenting Cesaire's unique voice as testament to a world reduced in size by catastrophic events." --<i>Bloomsbury Review </i><br><br>"Through his universal call for the respect of human dignity, consciousness and responsibility, he will remain a symbol of hope for all oppressed peoples." --Nicolas Sarkozy<br><br>"Evocative and thoughtful, touching on human aspiration far beyond the scale of its specific concerns with Cesaire's native land - Martinique." --<i>The Times</i></p><p>Poet and politician Aim� C�saire was born in Basse-Pointe, Martinique on June 26, 1913. He attended high school and college in France. While in Paris, he helped found the journal Black Student in the 1930s. During World War II, he returned to Martinique and was mayor of Fort-de-France from 1945 to 2001, except for a break from 1983 to 1984. He also served in France's National Assembly from 1946 to 1956 and from 1958 to 1993. In 1946, he helped Martinique shed its colonial status and become an overseas department of France. Some of his best known works include the book <i>Discourse on Colonialism</i>, the essay "Negro I Am, Negro I Will Remain", and <i>Return to My Native Land</i>. He was being treated for heart problems and other ailments when he died on April 17, 2008."Nothing less than the greatest lyrical monument of this time."<b>&nbsp;--Andr� Breton</b><br><br>""Aime C�saire's brooding exploration of Negritude bristles with the energetic, unique qualities of Walt Whitman's <i>Song of Myself</i> . . . [C�saire's] protean lyric, filled with historical allusions, serves to exorcise individual and collective self-hatreds engendered by the psychological trauma of slavery and its aftermath." <b>--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>"One of the most powerful French poets of the century."&nbsp;<b>--<i>New York Times Book Review<br><br></i></b>"The poem pulls no punches. Now tremulous, now grating, the improvised text drums and jabs in spasmodic phrases and slogans. Each encounter, each twist of idiom, thrusts itself into the reader&#x2019;s mind as a fierce challenge to understand and to empathize." <b>-- Roger Cardinal, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>"A more razor-sharp encapsulation of the situation of African slavery could not be found." <b>--<i>Quarterly Conversation</i></b><br><br>"Edouard Glissant once wrote that "everything begins with poetry." Aime Cesaire's epic poem was&nbsp;a true beginning in 1939. . . .<i>&nbsp;Return to my Native Land </i>became the rallying cry of decolonization but the fact that it is still read means it has survived as poetry. This translation preserves its poetic force and its reissue is a welcome event."&nbsp;<b>--J. Michael Dash, New York University<br></b><br><i>"Return to My Native Land</i> is a monumental tome to our times, and this new translation by John Berger and Anya Bostock possesses the tropical heat of the poet&#x2019;s sonority. Though, in his refrain, Aim� C�saire intones &#x201c;the small hours,&#x201d; there isn&#x2019;t anything small about the raw lyricism articulated into this incantation of fiery wit. The translators convey the spirit of improvisation, yet, with a deftness of image and music, they deliver this book-length poem as a seamless work of art&#x2014;an existential cry against a man-made void. What translates is the speaker&#x2019;s revolutionary psyche on to the page&#x2014;his fierce affirmation of existence through an eloquent clarity of the real and surreal. Nowhere is C�saire&#x2019;s passion sacrificed; this translation is a tribute to the poet."&nbsp;<b>--Yusef Komunyakaa, New York University&nbsp;</b><br><br>"amazing. . .

In this beautifully illustrated book, Douglas Harper and Patrizia Faccioli present a fascinating and colorful look at the Italian table.</p><p><i>The Italian Way</i> focuses on two dozen families in the city of Bologna, elegantly weaving together Harper&#x2019;s outsider perspective with Faccioli&#x2019;s intimate knowledge of the local customs. The authors interview and observe these families as they go shopping for ingredients, cook together, and argue over who has to wash the dishes. Throughout, the authors elucidate the guiding principle of the Italian table&#x2014;a delicate balance between the structure of tradition and the joy of improvisation. With its bite-sized history of food in Italy, including the five-hundred-year-old story of the country&#x2019;s cookbooks, and Harper&#x2019;s mouth-watering photographs, <i>The Italian Way</i> is a rich repast&#x2014;insightful, informative, and inviting.</p></p><p><p><b>Douglas Harper</b> is professor of sociology at Duquesne University; this is his fifth work of visual ethnography published by the University of Chicago Press. <b>Patrizia Faccioli </b>is associate professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and the author or editor of seven books in Italian.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Italian Way</i> is a deep, rich, and complex analysis of food practices and the way they implicate and are involved in every aspect of society. The descriptions of the meals are elegantly informal, but probing and informative. The photographs are integral to those descriptions&#x2014;not illustrations of some points the authors make, but points in their own right. Along the way you gain a complicated understanding of the nature of a &#x2018;proper&#x2019; Italian meal: what it has to contain, how it has to be served, what the acceptable limits of variation are, and many other things. I&#x2019;ve seldom read a work of sociology that left me feeling I had learned so much I didn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p> (Howard S. Becker, author of Tricks of the Trade and Telling About Society)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Italian Way</i> Harper and Faccioli present an intriguing discussion of Bolognese foodways that reveals much about Italian culture. The authors focus on how food reflects Italian identity, on the contrast between Italy&#x2019;s history of scarcity and its present abundance, and on food&#x2019;s expression of sacred and profane value systems. Historical and contemporary photographs complement the interviews to make <i>The Italian Way</i> an original look at eating in Bologna.&#x201d;</p> (Carole Counihan, author of Around the Tuscan Table: Food, Family and Gender in Twentieth Century Florence)<br><br>"An engaging and informative book, complete with photos and lively records of personal conversations."

Historically, these changes have occurred slowly enough to allow life to adapt and evolve. In more recent times, the chemistry of the Earth is being altered at a staggering rate, fueled by industrialization and an ever-growing human population. Human activities, from the rapid consumption of resources to the destruction of the rainforests and the expansion of smog-covered cities, are all leading to rapid changes in the basic chemistry of the Earth.<br>The Second Edition of <b>Biogeochemistry</b> considers the effects of life on the Earth's chemistry on a global level. This expansive text employs current technology to help students extrapolate small-scale examples to the global level, and also discusses the instrumentation being used by NASA and its role in studies of global change. With the Earth's changing chemistry as the focus, this text pulls together the many disparate fields that are encompassed by the broad reach of biogeochemistry. With extensive cross-referencing of chapters, figures, and tables, and an interdisciplinary coverage of the topic at hand, this text will provide an excellent framework for courses examining global change and environmental chemistry, and will also be a useful self-study guide.<br>* Emphasizes the effects of life on the basic chemistry of the atmosphere, the soils, and seawaters of the Earth<br>* Calculates and compares the effects of industrial emissions, land clearing, agriculture, and rising population on Earths chemistry<br>* Synthesizes the global cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur, and suggests the best current budgets for atmospheric gases such as ammonia, nitrous oxide, dimethyl sulfide, and carbonyl sulfide<br>* Includes an extensive review and up-to-date synthesis of the current literature on the Earths biogeochemistry</p><p>Dr. Schlesinger is one of the nation&#x2019;s leading ecologists and earth scientists and a passionate advocate for translating science for lay audiences.

In this outstanding text, Kehoe argues compellingly that the term is misused when applied to practitioners other than those from Siberia, where the term originated. Applying critical thinking techniques as a way of examining assumptions presented as fact, she deconstructs many commonly held notions of what shamanism is and isn&#39;t, closely critiquing widely cited articles and books on the subject. The problems discussed bring up important anthropological questions not limited to the anthropology of religion. How does the ethnographer distance his or her own (usually Western) socialization when describing the empirical reality of a culture? How does the reader of the anthropological literature do the same when analyzing others&#39; writings? Kehoe maintains that critical thinking, long the fundamental method guiding both academic scholarship and pedagogy, helps answer these questions.</p><p>Also by Alice Kehoe and available from Waveland Press: The Ghost Dance: Ethnohistory and Revitalization, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577664536) and The Kensington Runestone: Approaching a Research Question Holistically (ISBN 9781577663713).&#34;Kehoe has produced a most enlightening and erudite analysis of Eliade&#39;s work and the more general field of shamanic studies. At last someone in anthropology protests against Eliade&#39;s uncritical use of secondary and unreliable sources!

For the next ten hours, twelve hundred German guns showered shells on a salient in French lines. The massive weight of explosives collapsed dugouts, obliterated trenches, severed communication wires, and drove men mad. As the barrage lifted, German troops moved forward, darting from shell crater to shell crater. The battle of Verdun had begun. <br><br>In <em>Verdun</em>, historian Paul Jankowski provides the definitive account of the iconic battle of World War I. A leading expert on the French past, Jankowski combines the best of traditional military history-its emphasis on leaders, plans, technology, and the contingency of combat-with the newer social and cultural approach, stressing the soldier's experience, the institutional structures of the military, and the impact of war on national memory. Unusually, this book draws on deep research in French and German archives; this mastery of sources in both languages gives Verdun unprecedented authority and scope. In many ways, Jankowski writes, the battle represents a conundrum. It has an almost unique status among the battles of the Great War; and yet, he argues, it was not decisive, sparked no political changes, and was not even the bloodiest episode of the conflict. It is said that Verdun made France, he writes; but the question should be, What did France make of Verdun? Over time, it proved to be the last great victory of French arms, standing on their own. And, for France and Germany, the battle would symbolize the terror of industrialized warfare, "a technocratic Moloch devouring its children," where no advance or retreat was possible, yet national resources poured in ceaselessly, perpetuating slaughter indefinitely.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Jankowski</strong> is Raymond Ginger Professor of History at Brandeis University. His many books include <em>Stavinksy: A Confidence Man in the Republic of Virtue</em> and <em>Shades of</em> <em>Indignation: Political Scandals in France, Past and Present</em>.<br><br>"[Jankowski] has written what certainly must stand as the most definitive history of the World War I Battle of Verdun...In this majestically crafted book, the author exposes many of the myths about the battle that have developed over a century of narrative. He demonstrates an exceptional mastery of sources and method, as he mined the German as well as the French primary sources, and is equally adept at both traditional military history and the new social history that, until recently, dominated the enterprise...By exploring all the connections between what happened on the battlefield and its impact and legacy, Jankowski compellingly illuminates the complex interaction of myth and reality built up over time concerning the Battle of Verdun."--<em>Army History</em><p></p><br>"Brilliant." --<em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"The horrors have been described often and elaborately, but Mr. Jankowski is skillful enough that his accounts still provoke." --<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"One of its foremost virtues is to brush aside the insistence of modern folklore.... that Verdun imposed on its participants horrors unprecedented in history." --Max Hastings, <em>The Sunday Times</em><p></p><br>"Jankowski recognizes the significance of the battle that Maurice Genevoix, a French novelist and World War I veteran, was said to have called 'the battle-symbol of the entire 1914-1918 war...' He relies heavily on the memoirs, journals and letters of those who were present during the battle to complete his work." --<em>Army</em> magazine<p></p><br>"Jankowski has written a superb, definitive popular account of Verdun through the eyes of soldiers, military leaders, and citizens of the two nations." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Jankowski's revisionist book is a major achievement...The writing throughout is of the highest order... At every stage, Jankowski integrates the military narrative with broader political and cultural dimensions... Jankowski's book offers a model history of warfare." --Philip Jenkins, <em>Books &amp;</em> <em>Culture</em><p></p><br>"Paul Jankowski's <em>Verdun</em> is a great book, truly a masterwork of modern literature. On a much studied event (25 percent of all the many French books on World War I have been about the battle of Verdun), he has given us a work of rare originality and creativity. And he has done it with old fashioned virtues of grace and refinement. This is not only a new interpretation of a major subject. It is also a new model of how history might be written on many subjects." --David Hackett Fischer<p></p><br>"This fine book straddles two generations of writing on the Great War. It is a superb account of the unfolding of the battle from the viewpoint of the commanders, and a moving narrative of the tenacity of small groups of men pushed beyond the limits of human endurance." --Jay Winter, Yale University<p></p><br>"Paul Jankowski provides a balanced, scholarly account of the pivotal Battle of Verdun. Within a smoothly flowing narrative, he highlights critical themes in both traditional military history and the social history of warfare. This book is a first-stop source for students of the First World War, and a superb survey of what arguably stands the greatest battle in human history." --Edward G. Lengel, author of <em>To Conquer Hell: The Meuse-Argonne, 1918</em><p></p><br>"Paul Jankowski's <em>Verdun</em> is the first major study of the battle to appear in English for many years, and the first to draw fully on archival research on both sides.

Walter Burkert argues against a distorted view, toward a more balanced picture. &#x201c;Under the influence of the Semitic East&#x2015;from writers, craftsmen, merchants, healers&#x2015;Greek culture began its unique flowering, soon to assume cultural hegemony in the Mediterranean.&#x201d;</p><p>The rich and splendid culture of the ancient Greeks has often been described as emerging like a miracle from a genius of its own, owing practically nothing to its neighbors. Walter Burkert offers a decisive argument against that distorted view, replacing it with a balanced picture of the archaic period &#34;in which, under the influence of the Semitic East, Greek culture began its unique flowering, soon to assume cultural hegemony in the Mediterranean&#34;. Burkert focuses on the &#34;orientalizing&#34; century 750-650 B.C., the period of Assyrian conquest, Phoenician commerce, and Greek exploration of both East and West, when not only eastern skills and images but also the Semitic art of writing were transmitted to Greece. He tracks the migrant craftsmen who brought the Greeks new techniques and designs, the wandering seers and healers teaching magic and medicine, and the important Greek borrowings from Near Eastern poetry and myth. Drawing widely on archaeological, textual, and historical evidence, he demonstrates that eastern models significantly affected Greek literature and religion in the Homeric age.<p>Walter Burkert was Professor Emeritus of Classics, University of Zurich.</p></p><h2>American Girls in Red Russia: Chasing the Soviet Dream</h2><p>If you were an independent, adventurous, liberated American woman in the 1920s or 1930s where might you have sought escape from the constraints and compromises of bourgeois living? Paris and the Left Bank quickly come to mind. But would you have ever thought of Russia and the wilds of Siberia? This choice was not as unusual as it seems now. As Julia L. Mickenberg uncovers in <i>American Girls in Red Russia</i>, there is a forgotten counterpoint to the story of the Lost Generation: beginning in the late nineteenth century, Russian revolutionary ideology attracted many women, including suffragists, reformers, educators, journalists, and artists, as well as curious travelers. Some were famous, like Isadora Duncan or Lillian Hellman; some were committed radicals, though more were just intrigued by the &#x201c;Soviet experiment.&#x201d; But all came to Russia in search of social arrangements that would be more equitable, just, and satisfying. And most in the end were disillusioned, some by the mundane realities, others by horrifying truths.<br><br> Mickenberg reveals the complex motives that drew American women to Russia as they sought models for a revolutionary new era in which women would be not merely independent of men, but also equal builders of a new society. Soviet women, after all, earned the right to vote in 1917, and they also had abortion rights, property rights, the right to divorce, maternity benefits, and state-supported childcare. Even women from Soviet national minorities&#x2014;many recently unveiled&#x2014;became public figures, as African American and Jewish women noted. Yet as Mickenberg&#x2019;s collective biography shows, Russia turned out to be as much a grim commune as a utopia of freedom, replete with economic, social, and sexual inequities.<br><br><i>American Girls in Red Russia</i> recounts the experiences of women who saved starving children from the Russian famine, worked on rural communes in Siberia, wrote for Moscow or New York newspapers, or performed on Soviet stages. Mickenberg finally tells these forgotten stories, full of hope and grave disappointments.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Julia L. Mickenberg</b> is associate professor of American studies at the University of Texas at Austin. She is author of <i>Learning from the Left: Children&#x2019;s Literature, the Cold War, and Radical Politics in the United States</i> and coeditor of <i>Tales for Little Rebels: A Collection of Radical Children&#x2019;s Literature</i>.<br> &nbsp;"Julia Mickenberg's extensive research in US and Russian archives fills a significant gap in our knowledge of the roles played by US women in the Russian revolution and the Bolshevik and Stalinist regimes in the Soviet Union. This book is also an invaluable contribution to transnational American studies, because it treats US-Soviet political and cultural relations between 1905 and 1945. Long considered the purview of international relations and political scientists, the transnational connection of Americans and Russians in this period is actually a fascinating story of mutual influences." (<i>Critical Inquiry</i>)<br><br>"In this well-researched and wonderfully written volume, readers will find a story that has long been overlooked." (<i>Diplomatic History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Here, in taut, fascinating prose filled with quotes from writings of all sorts from the era,&nbsp;Mickenberg limns the many intrepid women who finagled their way into Russia, starting in the late nineteenth century, to help with everything that needed to be done, and that was a lot. &nbsp;. . . Though success stories are here, so is much disillusionment, as the reality failed to meet the promise.&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Mickenberg paints a vivid picture of the postrevolutionary Soviet Union as a society working to live up to lofty, and ultimately unrealized, ideals. . . . Mickenberg tells a relatively unknown story of the time in between, of the new woman&#x2019;s disappointments with America and her enthusiasm for Russia, and she does so with rich archival research and in beautiful prose. Graduate students and scholars of early-twentieth-century American feminism and the cultural history of Soviet/U.S. relations will be most interested in this book."<br> &nbsp; (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Mickenberg tells more than the story of specific women who traveled to Russia looking for a new way to live; she tells the universal story of how people struggle to live by their own values and ideals when those clash with the larger society. <i>American Girls in Red Russia</i> is equally inspiring and disheartening, and it is a reminder of the lengths one can and should go to stand by one&#x2019;s beliefs, while also reminding us that one can never quite go far enough.&#x201d;&nbsp; (Jessa Crispin, author of The Dead Ladies Project: Exiles, Expats, and Ex-Countries)<br><br>&#x201c;In this enthralling account, Mickenberg reveals the magnetic attraction of the new Soviet Union to American women seeking to reinvent working and family lives in the twenties.&nbsp;But <i>American Girls in Red Russia</i> also exposes the painful paradox of imagining freedom in a repressive culture. This is an illuminating achievement whose lessons speak to the&nbsp;utopian aspirations of men and women everywhere.&#x201d; (Alice Kessler-Harris, author of A Difficult Woman: The Challenging Life and Times of Lillian Hellman)<br><br><i>&#x201c;American Girls in Red Russia </i>combines incredible research and inspired writing in a compelling account of the American women who traveled to, lived in, and sometimes believed in the Soviet Union during its first decades. Mickenberg deftly combines political and cultural history to reveal a fascinating generation of radical women who chased &#x2018;the Soviet dream.&#x2019; She transports the reader into the lives of both famous and forgotten women who followed their curiosity and convictions to a brave new world. Sometimes they found fulfillment; more often, disappointment.&nbsp; Their stories enrich our understanding of early feminism at home and in the USSR while revealing the possibilities and limitations of living revolutionary lives."<br> &nbsp; (Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, coauthor of These United States: A Nation in the Making, 1890 to the Present)<br><br>"Julia L. Mickenberg's <i>American Girls in Red Russia</i> is a <i>tour de force</i> of rich storytelling, impressive research, and well-developed characters. . . . Beyond being a powerfully researched piece of scholarship that contributes to our understandings of American and Soviet culture in the 1920s and 1930s,<i> American Girls in Red Russia&nbsp;</i>has captured the spirit and excitement of these women as they set out to carve new identities for themselves. She makes readers care about these women, their dreams, their fates, and most importantly, their cause." (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"[Mickenberg] recovers a lost piece of social history with this absorbing account of the adventurous American women who went to live in the Soviet Union after the Bolshevik Revolution."&nbsp; (<i>Financial Times, Best of the Year Feature</i>)<br><br>"meticulously researched and well-written&nbsp;. . .

It was the worst school massacre in out nation's history. Can we prevent a tragedy like this from happening again?</p><p>In Elliot Aronson's <i>Nobody Left to Hate</i>, on of our nation's leading social psychologists argues that the negative atmosphere in our schools--the exclusion, taunting, humiliation, and bullying--played a major role in triggering the pathological behavior of the shooters. At the very least, such an atmosphere makes schools an unpleasant experience for most normal students.</p><p>But it doesn't have to be. <i>Nobody Left to Hate</i> offers concise, practical, and easy-to-apply strategies for creating a more supportive, stimulating, and compassionate environment in our schools. Based on decades of scientific research and classroom testing, these strategies explain how students can be taught to control their own impulses, how to respect others, and how to resolve conflicts amicably. In addition, they show teachers how to structure classes to promote cooperation, rather than competition, without sacrificing academics. On the contrary, education is greatly enhanced.</p><p>For parents, teachers, or anyone concerned with what is happening in our schools, <i>Nobody Left to Hate</i> provides a simple and effective plan of action that will make their children's school not only a safe place, but a more humane place of learning.</p></p><p>"Americans are too ready to blame individuals for social problems like youth violence. Elliot Aronson brings to bear the power of social psychology to help us understand why a negative school environment can push vulnerable kids over the edge and how restructuring that environment can bring them back into the fold. At a time when many people in public life are offering quick fixes and punitive strategies based upon faulty analyses of the problem, Aronson offers a road map for changing the social environment of the school from competition and nastiness to cooperation and acceptance. Bravo!" <br> -- James Garbarino, PhD, author of <i>Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them</i> and Professor of Human Development at Cornell University <p>"Dr. Aronson has written an important book. It has the potential to change how the public, and policy makers in particular, think about the Littleton tragedy and how to make our schools safe havens where the joy of learning is the focus--not the fear of violence.

This led to considerable discord, even enmity, and yielded fascinating and fruitful work of both a mathematical and a philosophical nature. It was one of the most exhilarating intellectual adventures of the century, pursued at an extraordinarily high level of acuity and imagination. Its legacy principally consists of three original and finely articulated programs that seek to view mathematics in the proper light: logicism, intuitionism, and finitism. Each is notable for its symbiotic melding together of philosophical vision and mathematical work: the philosophical ideas are given their substance by specific mathematical developments, which are in turn given their point by philosophical reflection. <br> <p>This book provides an accessible, critical introduction to these three projects as it describes and investigates both their philosophical and their mathematical components.<br> </p> <p>Solutions manual is available upon request.</p><b><br> </b> <p><b>Alexander George</b> is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Amherst College.

With his 8-by-10-inch view camera, he shot 46 different views of this vista, which are here reproduced as oversize colorplates. Misty gray morning, clear blue noonday, vivid sunset, gray-blue blanket of clouds, tide in, tide out--each image has its own form and color even though there is little but the horizon in view. <i>Bay/Sky</i> is a natural and more radical extension of Meyerowitz's landscape vision, and it contains some exquisite sights sure to delight both serious photography buffs and lovers of sunsets. Still, collections lacking <i>Cape Light</i> should add it before getting <i>Bay/Sky</i>, which is really a long coda to the earlier work. (A word of warning: Norman Mailer's silly introduction taints Meyerowitz's ethereal viewpoint with sexism, likening it to "a great beauty who is ready to reveal her nude secrets to but one photographer, her own private court photographer.") <i>Gretchen Garner</i>Evoking Monet's studies of light and Stieglitz's equivalents, Meyerowitz here refines a vision begun in his earlier collection depicting Cape Cod, Cape Light ( LJ 3/1/79). Using a balance of sea and sky where "attention is paid to everything in the frame," he has reached an ethereal formalism. Perspective and selective focus are no longer of primary concern; the horizon line becomes the only spatial marker in many images. The 47 color plates are meticulously printed from the 8 10 view-camera negatives. An introduction by Norman Mailer, the afterword by Meyerowitz, and a list of plates are the only text. An elegant eulogy to land's end and absolutely essential for all photography collections.<br><i>- Kathy J.

She was Professor of Education and Dean of the School of Education at American University. She died while undergoing treatment for breast cancer in 1995. Through her writings and lectures, Myra Sadker alerted Americans to the academic, physical, psychological and career costs of sexism. She wrote the first book for teachers on the issue of sexism in 1973. Over twenty years later, in 1994, she coauthored the first popular book on this topic: Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls. Between these two publications, Myra Sadker brought her cause for educational equity to a national audience. Along with her husband David, Myra Sadker spoke in more than forty states and overseas, giving hundreds of presentations and workshops for teachers and parents concerned with the negative impact of sexist behaviors. She wrote scores of articles on how to raise and teach children free from the debilitating impact of sexism. In her name, Myra Sadker Advocates was established to continue her efforts and create more equitable and effective schools.

She shows us that &#34;ripeness is all,&#34; that nothing can be taught to the child until it is ready to receive it or knowledge will sprout prematurely and wither early. This book will help us approach the child with sensitivity and insight.</p><p><b>Marjorie Spock</b> was born Sept. 8, 1904, in New Haven, Connecticut, the second child and first daughter of six children. The Spock family was prominent in New Haven; her father was a corporate lawyer, and her older brother, Dr. Benjamin Spock, became a renowned pediatrician. Marjorie became a student of Anthroposophy as a teenager in Dornach during the 1920s, and became a eurythmist, teacher, biodynamic gardener, and the author and translator of numerous books.

While keeping the flavor of the original book, we have made some changes to make the language more in keeping with today&#39;s English usage. We also changed some of the pictures and poems in hopes of making the book more interesting to young readers. Since this book is intended as a complete third grade course, or as a two year course for second and third grade, we have made some of the exercises near the end of the book more appropriate for the end of third grade. These selections are longer and provide more opportunities for writing. By the time the sudent has progressed through the course, he will be well equipped to handle these tasks. The beauty of this book is the balance between oral and written work. The exercises are intended to inspire conversation with the student about the use of language and to provide the child with practice using proper grammatical forms. This can be a very enjoyable time for teacher and student as they explore the beauty of the our language.</p><p>An experienced teacher of the early 20th century, Emma Serl recognized the two things necessary for teaching proper English: capture the child's interest and drill, drill, drill. <p>Primary Language Lessons is a drill book, but with a difference.

Born in a world where the weak died without mercy, where only the swift, the strong, the cunning saw each dawn. It was White Fang's world--until he and his mother were captured by the man-gods.</p><p>But men and their dogs taught White Fang to hate. He was beaten, abused, attacked. He was bought, sold, tortured, trained to kill in blood sports. Knowing no kindness, he became a mad, lethal, creature of pure rage.</p><p>Only one man saw White Fang's intelligence and nobility. Only one had the courage to offer the killer a new life. But can a wolf understand the word "hope"?

What is the relationship between national dreams and kitsch, between political and artistic utopia and everyday existence? Commonplaces of daily living would be perfect clues for those seeking to understand a culture. But all who write big books on Russian life confess their failure to get properly inside Russia, to understand its &#x201c;doublespeak.&#x201d;</p><p>Svetlana Boym is a unique guide. A member of the last Soviet Generation, the Russian equivalent of our Generation X, she grew up in Leningrad and has lived in the West for the past thirteen years. Her book provides a view of Russia that is historically informed, replete with unexpected detail, and everywhere stamped with authority. Alternating analysis with personal accounts of Russian life, Boym conveys the foreignness of Russia and examines its peculiar conceptions of private life and common good, of Culture and Trash, of sincerity and banality. Armed with a Dictionary of Untranslatable Terms, we step around Uncle Fedia asleep in the hall, surrounded by a puddle of urine, and enter the Communal Apartment, the central exhibit of the book. It is the ruin of the communal utopia and a unique institution of Soviet daily life; a model Soviet home and a breeding ground for grassroots informants. Here, privacy is forbidden; here the inhabitants defiantly treasure their bits of &#x201c;domestic trash,&#x201d; targets of ideological campaigns for the transformation (<i>perestroika</i>) of everyday life.</p><p>Against the Russian and Soviet myths of national destiny, the trivial, the ordinary, even the trashy, take on a utopian dimension. Boym studies Russian culture in a broad sense of the word; she ranges from nineteenth- and twentieth-century intellectual thought to art and popular culture. With her we go walking in Moscow and Leningrad, eavesdrop on domestic life, and discover jokes, films, and TV programs. Boym then reflects on the 1991 coup that marked the end of the Soviet Union and evoked <i>fin-de-si�cle</i> apocalyptic visions. The book ends with a poignant reflection on the nature of communal utopia and nostalgia, on homesickness and the sickness of being home.</p></p><p>Svetlana Boym was Curt Hugo Reisinger Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literatures at Harvard University.Visitors and outsiders have long lamented that the real lives of Soviet citizens were hidden behind a veil of official rhetoric. The private self was kept separate from the public self as a sort of defensive or coping mechanism. Boym (humanities, Harvard), who was raised in Leningrad but has lived in the West for 13 years, analyzes the dichotomy between the common meeting places of public life and the no-places of private life and discerns a cultural tradition that still persists. Her themes are the communal apartment (which deprived all residents of a private life), graphomania (the compulsion to bad writing), and the spiritual self in Russian philosophy. Examples are drawn from film, literature, painting, and philosophy of the 19th and, primarily, 20th centuries. Appropriate for academic and specialized collections.<br><i>Marcia L.

Voluptuous and shapely, she cut a striking silhouette. Resembling the siren she was purported to be, she looked to the west. A dark ship appeared on the horizon, and with its sighting, her pulse quickened. Was it the dark pirate captain who haunted her dreams? A tall and fierce warrior, his face was full of fury. And passion. With just a glance from him, her loins quivered. With a touch . . . implosion. <br> <br>Was it he? Returning from faraway lands and adventures she could only dream of, would he pillage and plunder her body as only he could? Would the pirate bestow upon her the treasure of his manhood? Or would he cast her aside as an empty booty? <br> <br>Would he?<br> <br>Would he?<br> <br>Would he care for another Diet Dr Pepper?<br> <br>Wait, what?<br> <br>I was torn from my pirate fantasy by the nasal, weenie voice of Richard Harrison, CPA. <br> <br>&#x201c;Can I get another Diet Dr Pepper, please? And for the lady, another&#x2014;what was it you&#x2019;re having, Viv?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Scotch. Water. Neat,&#x201d; I answered, looking across the table at the latest in a long line of blind dates. Set up by my mother, which should have been my first clue to say no and run screaming into that good night. Not that she didn&#x2019;t have good taste; she&#x2019;d picked a looker with Richard. Strike that&#x2014;he was a looker if that&#x2019;s what you were into.<br> <br>Brown hair. Brown eyes. Brown chinos, perfectly creased. White button-down. White teeth. Blindingly white, actually; I was pretty sure when he smiled chimes went off. Every time a CPA smiled, a fairy got its wings? <br> <br>Jesus, Viv, get a grip.<br> <br>I sipped my Scotch, wincing not only at the good burn, but at the bad turn this conversation was taking. Tax laws over appetizers. Nothing like a little burrata caprese with a side of capital gains.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d gotten through the first twenty minutes of Current Bad Date by letting my mind wander to my favorite place, Romance Novel Central. But now even the thought of pirates marauding through my underwear couldn&#x2019;t spare me from the drone of brown-brown-brown-white-white-boring.<br> <br>I let my eyes wander around the restaurant, fingering the small locket around my neck. Shell-pink and ivory, the tiny cameo had been given to me when I was thirteen. A family heirloom, it had been given to me as a confirmation gift. My family was still active in the church; not so much me. Although I did love a good fish fry. With a side of guilt, thank you very much. Which was why I was here on a Friday night instead of relaxing with a good book. <br> <br>Directly above my heirloom cameo was a face &#x201c;framed by wisps of dark curly hair, with golden tanned skin, and sea-glass-green eyes.&#x201d; This is how my mother sold me to Richard Harrison, CPA, and aforementioned weenie. I did in fact have dark curly hair, all two inches of it, and I did have green eyes. Golden skin? Well, it was tan, I&#x2019;ll give her that. But what she neglected to mention was the barbell in my left eyebrow. She usually also left out the nose piercing, tongue piercing, and the tattoo at the base of my neck. When I took off my leather jacket earlier, it made Mr. Harrison cringe a bit, but he held his own. Barely five two in socks but almost five four in my favorite combat boots, I knew very well the image I was projecting&#x2014;certainly one at odds with the family�friendly TGI McGeneric restaurant he&#x2019;d brought me to. All the great restaurants in South Philadelphia, and he brings me here?<br> <br>Why in the world did I let myself get talked into another blind date?<br> <br>Because you&#x2019;re single, you&#x2019;ve never been in love, and you&#x2019;re Desperately Seeking Pirate?<br> <br>True. I&#x2019;d also take a cowboy. Or a fireman. Or an estranged prince separated from his royal bloodline by a ruthless uncle hell-bent on obtaining the throne, especially when it came along with the maiden princess from a rival kingdom, the most beautiful creature in all the land. Too bad for the uncle that the maiden had been de-maidened by said prince on a bed of snowy-white down feathers. And when the prince thrust into his lady love, her nails scored into his back like those of an eagle taking flight, a flight into passionate&#x2014;<br> <br>Whoa. No more Scotch. <br> <br>Ten solid minutes later of listening to him wax poetic about tax shelters and Roth IRAs, I set my glass down and stared at him. I could be luxuriating in a bubble bath and inside my head with the pirate king, but I was listening to this? I was perfectly capable of finding my own dates, a fact I lectured my mother about over and over again. Though actually putting this capability into practice was a different matter; a practice I didn&#x2019;t really engage in. It wasn&#x2019;t that I wasn&#x2019;t interested in dating; I was. To a point. I just didn&#x2019;t have any patience for the small-talk two-step that one needed to engage in to catch a feller. <br> <br>I knew that life couldn&#x2019;t be like a romance novel, where someone could fall hopelessly in love with her soul mate the moment they met eyes across a crowded room. <br> <br>Preposterous. <br> <br>Or that you could be whisked off into a world of fantasy and excitement by a handsome stranger, instantly connect, and be in perfect sexual sync from the second his mammoth male member teased your delicate flower petals. <br> <br>The idea. <br> <br>Or that there was a billionaire bad boy at the head of every Fortune 100 company who was in his late twenties, six feet, three inches of barely tamed unchecked male aggression who was waiting for a tiny waif of a girl with no self-esteem and Chuck Taylor sneakers with no socks to knock him off his pedestal and change the course of his life over a two-martini lunch and a quickie in the restaurant ladies&#x2019; room. <br> <br>For the record? Wearing Chucks with no socks makes your feet stink like bags of disgusting. <br> <br>However. For all the ridiculous perpetuated in a romance novel, I still longed for the fantasy. The fairy tale. The wonderful give and take that occurred when two became one. So I went out on dates, met guys in bars, picked them up occasionally, and had the mostly bland, occasionally inventive, sex of the single-girl encounters. Orgasms, whether by my own hand or someone else&#x2019;s, could never be discounted. So when my mother wore me down every few months about being the only one of my siblings who wasn&#x2019;t married, I relented and let her set me up on blind dates. <br> <br>My type and my mother&#x2019;s type were as different as tuna fish and a curling iron. I liked a bad boy, and had enjoyed some a time or two. I preferred them a bit rough, tough looking. Messy hair? Yes, please. Artistic? Yes, please&#x2014;musician, painter, performance artist, what have you. <br> <br>My mother&#x2019;s type was everyone&#x2019;s type: good provider, steady, accomplished, smart, sociable at parties, and enough sperm to breed Catholic guilt into the next generation several times over. <br> <br>And in this latest surge of motherly influence, no doubt spawned by the birth of her third grandchild and her wild desire to have a baker&#x2019;s dozen, lately she had been setting up dates for me like it was going out of style. In the last two weeks alone I&#x2019;d been out with Harry Thomson, Tommy Dickerson, and now Richard Harrison. A financial planner, a tax lawyer, and now a CPA. Same guy, same pants, same brain. Tom, Dick, and Harry? Oh hell, no . . . <br> <br>&#x201c;So I said to the guy, if you want to roll over all of this into a 401(k) I&#x2019;ll do that, but you&#x2019;d miss out on the more attractive shelter over here! So what I proposed was&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dick? Can I call you Dick?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;d prefer Richard, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dick, I&#x2019;m going to stop you right here. This was a mistake.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked crestfallen. &#x201c;Darn it all, I knew we should have ordered the chicken fingers. This berretta cheese is a little too exotic for my taste too. Let me see if I can get our waitress and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He held up his hand for some help with his &#x201c;berretta,&#x201d; and I slapped mine on the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the cheese, it&#x2019;s not the restaurant, it&#x2019;s not even you, Dick. It&#x2019;s me. I should never have let my mother talk me into this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother is terrific. Great assets.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No more asset talk. I want to be romanced; I want to be swept away&#x2014;I want something special, rare, passionate, out of the ordinary!&#x201d; I replied, my voice rising as I got worked up. I leaned across the table. &#x201c;I want someone who will sweep everything off the table, throw me across it, and ravage me to within an inch of my life. Can you do that, Dick?&#x201d; I slammed down the rest of my Scotch, meeting his eyes in challenge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Passionate? Out of the ordinary?&#x201d; He gulped, pulling at his tie. Then a strange look came over his face. &#x201c;You mean like, in the butt?&#x201d; he whispered with an exaggerated wink. <br> <br>Oh. My. God. <br> <br>&#x201c;How we doing over here?&#x201d; a cheerful voice asked, and I looked up into the face of our waitress. <br> <br>&#x201c;Dick needs some chicken fingers.&#x201d; I sighed, taking a twenty out of my purse and setting it on the table next to my empty glass. I pushed back from the table, went around to his side, and patted him on the shoulder. &#x201c;Sorry this didn&#x2019;t work out.&#x201d; The relief was so very evident on his face it was almost comical. He started to stand, and I waved him off as I grabbed my jacket and headed for the door.<br> <br>Another one bites the dust. Or chicken finger, in this case. <br> <br>As I shut the front door to my home, the silence was palpable. My shoes rang out dully against polished concrete, the lights low and a bit lonely. I peeled off my jacket, snickering once more when I thought of Dick&#x2019;s face when I took it off. Tattoos were commonplace in this day and age, but there&#x2019;s nothing like neck ink on a girl to make a guy in a suit blink. I shouldn&#x2019;t snicker; he didn&#x2019;t deserve total annihilation like that. Not over appetizers. I tamped the snicker down as I passed by the wall photo of my mom on my way to kitchen. &#x201c;Sorry, Ma, but come on. Berretta?&#x201d;<br> <br>I may have snickered once more. Just the one.<br> <br>Contemplating the effects tomorrow morning of having one more bump of Scotch tonight, and deciding the hell with it, I splashed a little more into a glass and leaned back against the counter. Polished concrete, like the floor. My home had an industrial feel to it: clean, uncluttered, orderly. Steel, chrome, blacks, and shades of&#x2014;you know. <br> <br>Along one wall was a line of pictures, all in black frames with black mattes. Spaced exactly three inches apart (above, below, and in between) were photos of my family. Five older brothers. Mom. Dad. All of us together. <br> <br>It had been interesting, growing up. By the time my parents got around to having me, they were so used to football, hockey, and baseball, that into the jerseys I went, and never even entertained the idea of a dress. I wore dresses sometimes now, but they were the skintight-over-fishnets-and-combat-boots type. Courtney Love circa 1996. Without the smeared lipstick. Or the heroin.<br> <br>Growing up with five older brothers meant that everyone in town saw me as one of the &#x201c;Franklin Boys.&#x201d; Something that became harder to lump me into when I developed serious lumps of my own when I hit puberty, but the fact that I ran around in ball caps and sweatshirts continued the myth. Following in my brothers&#x2019; footsteps also meant that I excelled at school, particularly math and science, taking calculus in tenth grade. Franklins are good at math and science, therefore as a Franklin, I was too. The hitch in the giddy-up was that I also loved art. Drawing, painting, you name it, I loved it. There&#x2019;s a symmetry to drawing, an innate sense of placement and scale that appealed to my inner math geek. But between after-school sports and advanced placement college prep classes, it was a side that I didn&#x2019;t have much time to explore. <br> <br>And frankly wasn&#x2019;t encouraged to explore. The family business was computers, and that&#x2019;s what all of us were groomed for. And I followed suit&#x2014;for a while. <br> <br>Next to the framed pictures of my family was the single piece of artwork in the room, the only piece that was in color. Bold splashes of bright corals, cotton-candy pinks, soft curling puffs of white. April in Paris. I let my eyes follow the swoops and swirls of color, remembering what it felt like to spend my days in a studio in France. Heaven. A heaven that was a world and a computer software company away.<br> <br>I pushed the thoughts aside, draining the rest of my Scotch and fumbling for my phone. I decided to bite the bullet and check my messages. There were at least three from my mother and two from an unknown number. Knowing that Mother just wanted to see how the date went, and not caring about messages from someone I didn&#x2019;t know, I erased them all and headed for my bedroom.<br> <br>Slipping out of my clothes and into a fluffy white robe, I made my way toward the only room in the house that didn&#x2019;t have my monochromatic modern theme. I opened the door into rosy chaos.<br> <br>Rose wallpaper, rose carpet&#x2014;if there was a surface I could stick a rose onto, I did it. Gold candelabras too; I had plenty of those. White taper candles with romantic drips spilling down them&#x2014;it was all there. My private escape. My romantic nirvana.<br> <br>Soaker tub. Deep. Long. With a shelf overflowing with bubble bath gels, salts, pearls, and oils. Fragrances of lavender, geranium, and of course, rose. I flipped on the radio, tuned to the local classical station, and felt the evening fade away as I turned on the hot water. While I poured the rose-scented bubbles into the stream, my eyes zeroed in on the book I&#x2019;d be finishing tonight. On the cover? Man. Strong. Fierce. Pecs. Woman. Beautiful. Swooning. Boobs.<br> <br>Dropping the robe and all memories of Dick Weenie, I slipped into the perfumed water and let my world fade away. <br> <br>I was sound asleep when my cell phone rang, jolting me out of a dream in which a giant shoe was chasing me down a water slide. I grappled across the nightstand, knocking over a stack of books and a water bottle, finally clutching my phone. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br> <br>Static.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, is this Ms. Vivian Franklin?&#x201d; a man&#x2019;s voice asked. <br> <br>&#x201c;This is Viv, yeah, who is this?&#x201d; I barked, noticing the time. Who the hell called at 1:28 a.m.? &#x201c;Do you have any idea what time it is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am terribly sorry for the time difference. It&#x2019;s considerably earlier here in California.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, bully for all the granola eaters. Who the hell are you, and what the hell are you doing calling me in the middle of the night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ms. Franklin, I did try calling earlier in the evening. Did you not get my messages?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Five seconds, California, or I&#x2019;m hanging up,&#x201d; I growled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Forgive me for saying so, but you do remind me of your aunt.&#x201d; He laughed a cultured laugh, and I frowned.<br> <br>&#x201c;My aunt?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t resemble either Aunt Gloria or Aunt Kimberly, and neither of them lived in California. Wait a minute&#x2014; &#x201c;Are you breathing heavy?&#x201d; Ick, he was! &#x201c;Dude, you picked the wrong chick for an obscene call&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, no, Ms. Franklin. I just climbed up a rather long staircase, and I&#x2019;m afraid the old ticker isn&#x2019;t quite what it used to be.&#x201d; After taking a deep breath, he laughed. &#x201c;Obscene&#x2014;the idea. Your Aunt Maude would have loved that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Aunt Maude. Aunt Maude? Ohhhh, Aunt Maude.<br> <br>&#x201c;As in my Great-Aunt Maude? Maude Perkins?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, the very one. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve heard this time and again in the last few days, but let me please extend to you my condolences.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Condolences?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, on your aunt&#x2019;s passing.

This volume presents those manuscripts for the first time, exactly as mark Twain wrote them.<br><br>Paine's disingenuous account of the history of his edition has, until recently, misled critics into believing that Mark Twain's creative abilities deserted him for a time, only to be recovered in the composition of <i>The Mysterious Stranger</i>. By writing this tale, said Bernard DeVoto, Mark Twain "saved himself in the end, and came back from the edge of insanity, and found as much peace as any man may find in his last years, and brought his talent into fruition and made it whole again." Although most critics have praised the work as the finest fiction of Mark Twain's later years, Paine and his collaborator, Frederick A. Duneka, so changed many of the book's essentials that it does not fully or accurately reflect the author's mood and thought.<br><br>Paine's edition of the book was based, for the most part, on the earliest of the three versions, written during the time of Mark Twain's supposed creative paralysis. He and Duneka suppressed a quarter of the text of this manuscript and grafted onto it the last chapter of the latest version. Mark Twain began the first manuscript, "The Chronicle of Young Satan," in 1897; late in 1898, he tried to recast the story in a Hannibal setting, then returned to his first version, only to abandon it permanently in 1900. Between 1902 and 1908, he worked on the third and longest version, the only one the author called "The Mysterious Stranger."<br><br>The publication of these texts therefore offers an opportunity to observe Mark Twain's sustained literary struggle with a central theme and to reevaluate the tantalizing question of the author's late work.</p><p><b>William M.

Individuals with ASD and related disorders are supported by a variety of people throughout their day, whether in educational and work settings, transition programs, or at home. Structured work systems are one method that can be used to ensure that they develop and maintain their ability to work on their own without assistance and prompting from others. The characteristics and benefits of structured work systems are explained in this well-illustrated book. Structured work systems provide visual information about what work needs to be done, how much works needs to be done, when the work is completed, and what will happen next. Due to the predictability and sense of accomplishment that is built into the system, many individuals with ASD find that structured work time is their favorite time of the day. Full of colorful photos and case examples spanning different ages and levels of functioning, the book provides an A-Z guide to work systems, including assessment, how to build them into the curriculum, IEPs, lesson planning and more tools geared toward individuals with ASD.

Shannon Mundy, EdS, director of Special Education, Mountain Brook Schools, Alabama<br><br>Structured work systems are critical for many individuals with autism spectrum and related disorders at school, home, and in the community. Reeve and Kabot offer a clear description and practical guidelines for implementing structured work systems from assessment through progress monitoring. The structured work systems and specific activity examples provide a starting point for developing and organizing tasks that the reader can then build upon. The text is especially beneficial for beginning teachers and individuals new to working with students with ASD or to implementing structured work systems. --Christi Carnahan, EdD, assistant professor, University of Cincinnati; co-author of QUALITY LITERACY INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS<br><br>Probably the most challenging aspect of work systems is illustrating the application of this visual support to the Common Core. Reeve and Kabot take TEACCH's approach over the past 40 years and demonstrate high quality of detail in illustrating some curriculum related directly to the Common Core. Here you will find creatively developed activities that address the characteristics of autism spectrum disorders at multiple levels while ensuring attention to the Common Core across ability and age levels ... Practical data sheets, multiple illustrations to show different systems, settings, and formats, and a useful list of materials to assist work system development all make this a vital resource for teacher trainers and for teachers attempting to provide quality educational services to students with ASD. --John B.

Most extraordinary, though, is the revolutionary method Blake employed in making the physical book. The Bodleian Library holds one of the first copies that Blake printed using a technique he called "illuminated printing," and it is the only work in which he signifies its importance.<p>This new facsimile edition of<i> The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> includes a plate-by-plate guide to the texts, interlinear figures, and larger designs in a commentary accompanying the transcript of each reproduced plate. Drawings from Blake&#x2019;s manuscript notebook, which were used as a basis for the designs, as well as working proof impressions, are also included, demonstrating the evolution of the work. This edition also reproduces a single plate from each of the other eight surviving copies, revealing how over a period of more than thirty years Blake altered the way he finished each copy. An introduction explores the book's literary and historical background, Blake&#x2019;s printing process, and the book's anonymous initial publication. </p><p>This expertly edited work is available for students and scholars in paperback and for collectors in a special hardcover edition.

As well as the facsimile of Copy B, one of the earliest of the nine known copies of the book, there are twenty-one valuable supplementary color plates of comparable pages from other copies, including a full run of Plate 14 as it occurs in the nine copies produced between 1793 to the year of his death, 1827. The detailed commentary discusses both text and illustrations, and in the case of the illustrations is most helpfully accompanied by appropriate details from Blake's designs.&#x201d; &#x2014; Martin Butlin, formerly Keeper of the British Collection, Tate Gallery, London, editor of the catalogue raisonne of the Complete Paintings and Drawings of William Blake</p> (Martin Butlin)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This edition of one of Blake&#x2019;s most potent and provocative books will give great pleasure both to Blake enthusiasts and to those new to his work.&#x201d;</p> (Tracy Chevalier)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This is an excellent scholarly edition of one of Blake&#x2019;s most fascinating works, likely to become the defining text for generations to come.

Once again, Lindberg doesn't disappoint. More than 50 patterns, inspired by Viking ancestors and religious and folk traditions in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, will busy any stitcher's fingers. As it should, the entire book focuses on the projects, curiously contemporary in their colors, shapes, and applications.

Rather than avoiding what is most glaringly un-modern or what is most criticized by non-Catholics, Balthasar reviews these elements one by one, and shows how they are rooted in the central Christian mysteries and the commonly accepted tradition. What is specifically Catholic is not defended polemically, but described in such a way that others can see, even from their own point of view, the inner consistency with the mystery affirmed by all. Here is a form of thought which is truly ecumenical precisely because it is fully Catholic. <p><br>"We are not only interested in those aspects of the mystery of the Roman Catholic Church which set her apart from the other Christian communities, but also to show how often they are central beliefs by describing what is specifically Catholic in such a way that the partner in dialogue can see, even from his own standpoint, the inner consistency." <br><br><b>-Hans Urs von Balthasar </b></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Everett Grist's Big Book of Marbles: A Comprehensive Identification &amp; Value Guide for Both Antique and Machine-Made Marbles</h2><p>Many new color photographs showcasing thousands of machine made and contemporary marbles have been added to make this book an even bigger Big Book of Marbles.

The Thanksgiving Sing was special. So was the Spellathon. The Emerging Artists exhibition was special. Even the unassuming Pie Drive was, for reasons not clearly revealed by the newsletter coverage, special indeed. And, finally, this year's third-grade class was in itself a very, very special group. </p><p> I wondered, Is it possible? So much specialness concentrated in one place? A cosmic coincidence? Or was this really an extraordinary school with unusually dazzling children, committed teachers, generous and energetic families? In fact, this school is a fine and good one. The children are intelligent and well behaved, the teachers care, the parents give of their time and money. But it is not a terribly unusual school, and I questioned the benefit of believing otherwise. </p><p> The third-grade newsletter was not unique. At nearly every campus I visit, the staff, the posters on the walls, and the overall atmosphere emphasize that this is not merely a place of learning, it's a breeding ground for enlightened, compassionate champions. The schools are not to blame for their hubris. Parents, with their grand expectations for their children, have sparked the outbreak of specialness. </p><p> My friend Paula, who runs a terrific elementary school, told of taking a mother on a prospective parents' tour of the campus. The mom said that her daughter Sloane had a strong interest in science. "At another school I visited, the kindergarten teachers put streamers in the trees to demonstrate the properties of wind to the students," she reported. "I'm hoping you would do that here too. I wouldn't want Sloaner to miss out." </p><p> "We have leaves on our trees," Paula responded. "They do the same thing. Can't guarantee we'll be using streamers." Sloane's mother sent her daughter to the school with the streamers. </p><p> The principal of another school complained to me about his frustration with parents' expectations: </p><p> Too many parents want everything fixed by the time their child is eight. They want academic perfection, a child as capable as any other child in the Western hemisphere. Children develop in fits and starts, but nobody has time for that anymore. No late bloomers, no slow starters, nothing unusual accepted! If a child doesn't get straight A's, his parents start fretting that he's got a learning disability or a motivation problem. The normal curve has disappeared. Parents seem to think that children only come in two flavors: learning disabled and gifted. Not every child has unlimited potential in all areas. This doesn't mean most kids won't be able to go to college and to compete successfully in the adult world. Almost all of them will. Parents just need to relax a little and be patient. </p><p> What's going on here? Why does the newsletter shout hosannas? Why is Sloane's mother so anxious for her daughter to experience a miniature physics lab in kindergarten? Why can't parents let their eight-year-olds develop at a natural, raggedy pace? </p><p> When I began studying Judaism, one of the first things that struck me was how directly it spoke to the issue of parental pressure. According to Jewish thought, parents should not expect their children to be anyone other than who they are. A Hasidic teaching says, "If your child has a talent to be a baker, don't tell him to be a doctor." Judaism holds that every child is made in the divine image. When we ignore a child's intrinsic strengths in an effort to push him toward our notion of extraordinary achievement, we are undermining God's plan. </p><p> If the pressure to be special gets too intense, children end up in the therapist's office suffering from sleep and eating disorders, chronic stomachaches, hair-pulling, depression, and other ailments. They are casualties of their parents' drive for perfection. It was children such as these who spurred me to look outside standard therapeutic practices for ways to help. In Judaism I found an approach that respects children's uniqueness while accepting them in all their ordinary glory. <br> </p><p> MISSION: PERFECTION </p><p> In Chapter 1 I described my surprise and confusion when, after conducting tests and telling parents that their child was "within normal limits," the parents were frequently disappointed. In their view, a diagnosable problem was better than a normal, natural limitation. A problem can be fixed, but a true limitation requires adjustment of expectations and acceptance of an imperfect son or daughter. Parents feel hope if their restless child is actually hyperactive, their dreamy child has ADD, their poor math student has a learning disorder, their shy child has a social phobia, their wrongdoing son has "intermittent explosive disorder." If there is a diagnosis, specialists and tutors can be hired, drugs given, treatment plans made, and parents can maintain an illusion that the imperfection can be overcome. Their faith in their child's unlimited potential is restored. </p><p> Why are parents so anxious to be raising perfect children? The answer is twofold: pride and fear of the future. </p><p> <br> <i>My Child, My Masterpiece</i> </p><p> Janet asked for advice from me and the other members of our parenting class about how to "talk sense" to her older son. </p><p> Do you know about the Johns Hopkins Talent Search? They offer sixth graders the chance to take the SAT. If a student scores in the same range as the average twelfth grader on either verbal or math he qualifies for a special summer academic program on a college campus. I know that Dylan would qualify in math but he says he doesn't want to sit for the test. This is crazy because the school wouldn't even know his score and if he makes it and enters the talent search program it would look great on his transcript. </p><p> Laypeople call it bragging; psychologists describe it as "achievement by proxy syndrome." Some parents use their children's achievements for their own sense of security, personal glory, or the fulfillment of unfulfilled dreams. Even parents who don't use their children as a hedge against existential fears or a badge of their own worth can find it hard not to succumb to the fever of competition. </p><p> It wasn't always this way. In the past, parents produced children for their work value (hands to labor on the farm). Today many parents see their children's achievement as an important family "product." This attitude leads to an upside-down, child-centered perspective where we cater to children's whims yet pressure them to achieve at all costs -- academically, socially, and athletically. But this pressure can backfire. </p><p> Children who feel that they are expected to surpass their parents' already high level of achievement or to demonstrate skills that are beyond their capabilities will suffer. Some children are one-trick ponies, and trying to get them to master a broad variety of skills is futile and destructive. Keep at it, and they'll even forget their one trick. Other children begin to feel as if they are working only for their parents' satisfaction, and they openly rebel. Some respond to the pressure by losing their intrinsic enjoyment of mastering skills, and still others use psychosomatic symptoms to get out of the running. By exaggerating their defects, these children hope to avoid failure and to have their progress measured by more individual, realistic standards. </p><p> Your child is not your masterpiece. According to Jewish thought, your child is not even truly "yours." In Hebrew there is no verb for possession; the expression we translate as "to have," <i>yesh li,</i> actually means "it is there for me" or "there is for me." Although nothing belongs to us, God has made everything available on loan and has invited us to borrow it to further the purpose of holiness. This includes our children. They are a precious loan, and each one has a unique path toward serving God. Our job is to help them find out what it is. </p><p> <br> <i>Conquering the Future with Brave Little Generalists</i> </p><p> If children were required to excel only in certain areas, they might be better able to cope with their parents' expectations. Psychologist Michael Thompson says that we make unfairly "generic" demands on our adolescents: "It is the only period in your life when you're expected to do all things well. Adults don't hold themselves to those standards. We don't interview the pediatrician about whether he can throw a basketball, or quiz our accountant on biology before we let her do our taxes. In elementary and high school we celebrate the generalist, but in the real world there is no room for the generalist except on Jeopardy!" </p><p> The age at which we expect children to become very good at everything is getting lower. Part of the reason for this is parents' fears of an uncertain future, one that is hurtling at us more quickly than ever before. The computer bought today can be replaced by a cheaper, lighter, snappier-looking one with a faster modem by the time we get it out of the box. Parents worry that in this hyperpaced world, only the child who excels at everything will survive. If young Maya can't design her own Web site, stay at the very top of her class, run a marathon, and speak confidently before large groups, she'll be left in the dust. </p><p> Our attempts to prepare our children for the future are limited by our own imaginations of what the future will be like. We're apprehensive, but our children are not. The high-tech, rapidly changing world that seems so mind-bending to us is normal to them. "Preparing" our children for this new world by turning them into supercompetitive generalists is useless because we can't second-guess the skills they will need twenty years from now. The only things that are certain to be valuable are character traits such as honesty, tenacity, flexibility, optimism, and compassion -- the same traits that have served people well for centuries. </p><p> <br> <i>Fear of the Ordinary: Lake Wobegon Parenting</i> </p><p> Remember Lake Wobegon, the fictional town created by Garrison Keillor, where "all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average"? That sunny, statistics-defying state of mind is familiar turf for elementary school teachers. They describe hearing the same song every year when it's time for parent conferences. One weary middle school director told me, </p><p> Parents are so nervous. If their child is doing well in everything it's like a badge for them that everything is OK. If their child is, God forbid, average, they panic. That's why so many teachers have started giving "Lake Wobegon" report cards. Teachers are afraid that if they give anything less than an A, parents will blame their child's poor achievement on the teacher's lack of skill rather than on the child's limitations. This is a shame, because real problems get glossed over or missed until fourth grade, when there's no more hiding it and the child's weaker areas show up on standardized tests. </p><p> Some parents can maintain the specialness myth with their children long past fourth grade. Is this good for the child's self-esteem? Listen to Isabel, a student I interviewed at an elite private school. Isabel will be entering the eleventh grade next year. She told me that she was having a hard time socially. The last two boys she wanted to have as boyfriends hadn't been interested in her. Her teachers seemed to favor other students. She felt confused and hurt: </p><p> I know why this is so hard for me. My mom and dad always, always made me feel like I was the best: the most beautiful, the smartest, the most charming. And mostly I've done well in everything. But, now I'm finding out that I'm not that unusual. Maybe I'm good enough, but I don't know anymore. </p><p> Like so many parents, Isabel's mother and father were afraid their daughter would think she was ordinary. Whether they were also reluctant to admit to themselves that their child was "merely" average, I don't know. But their Lake Wobegon attitude has not benefited Isabel. They've put her on a pedestal and now she's stuck up there, unable to find out what level she would reach if she had a chance to bob around with everybody else. </p><p> <br> <i>Boys and Girls: Equal but Different</i> </p><p> There is another aspect of contemporary child-rearing that places still more pressure on our children. Over the past twenty years, teachers and social scientists have downplayed the differences between boys and girls. It's been done as a corrective to a history of inequality, but the result is that we've come to expect boys to behave like girls and girls like boys in circumstances where this is difficult for them. There's no question that all children should be encouraged to pursue whatever field interests them, but a gender-blind approach can sometimes increase the stress on our overstressed kids. Gone are the gender-based safe havens of the past; now both sexes have the opportunity -- the obligation -- to excel in every arena, from academics to sports, from being a good listener to being a leader. </p><p> God is the original maker of distinctions: light from darkness, the seventh day of rest from the six days of labor, sacred from profane. While remaining aware of the potential for discrimination, we can also remain respectful of innate distinctions between boys and girls. For example, their interests and developmental stages are often different. Instead of trying to ignore or flatten these differences, we can pay attention to the ways they are revealed in our children's behavior. If you fear that acknowledging any gender differences will lead to unfair treatment, your children may miss out on getting what they need. In order to treat our daughters and sons fairly it is sometimes necessary to treat them differently. Honoring distinctions can lead to equal opportunity. </p><p> <br> <i>Inappropriate Expectations of Boys</i> </p><p> Laurie's son, Noah, was born when her daughter, Rachel, was four. "I was amazed at the differences from the start," she said. "When Noah was a baby he shouted 'Ball!' whenever he saw the letter O. He insisted that I walk on the trafficky side of the street instead of the lovely tree-lined residential side so he could see the trucks up close. He called out to every one, 'Rrruuum! Rrruuum!'" </p><p> Noah concentrated so hard that he could do only one thing at a time. If Laurie wanted him to listen to her, she had to hold his three-year-old face in her hands. She couldn't take him with her on errands because he'd run away. Laurie and her husband, Mark, decided that they would never allow Noah to have toy guns or to watch TV, only educational videos. That didn't stop Noah from shooting at everything -- he'd just cock his finger or make a gun out of his toast or a graham cracker. </p><p> What will happen when this truck-loving, hyperfocused, shoot-'em-up guy gets to kindergarten? When he has to sit still at a table for a chunk of the day and practice printing upper- and lowercase letters? When he has to cooperate nicely <i>all day long?</i> When no fart noises or finger guns are permitted? ("Noah, I know you remember how to use your words, right, Noah?") </p><p> Here's what his teacher might tell Laurie: "Noah h...</p></p><h2>German Quickly: A Grammar for Reading German (American University Studies, Series 6, Foreign Language Instruction, Vol. 5)</h2><p>German Quickly: A Grammar for Reading German is a thorough, straightforward textbook with a sense of fun.

Ingrid D. Rowland&#x2019;s biography establishes him once and for all as a peer of Erasmus, Shakespeare, and Galileo&#x2014;a thinker whose vision of the world prefigures ours.<br> <br> Writing with great verve and erudition, Rowland traces Bruno&#x2019;s wanderings through a sixteenth-century Europe where every certainty of religion and philosophy has been called into question, and reveals how he valiantly defended his ideas to the very end, when he was burned at the stake as a heretic on Rome&#x2019;s Campo de&#x2019; Fiori.<br> &#x201c;A loving and thoughtful account of [Bruno&#x2019;s] life and thought, satires and sonnets, dialogues and lesson plans, vagabond days and star-spangled nights. . . .

It&#x2019;s that feeling for the explosiveness of the period, and [Rowland&#x2019;s] admiration of Bruno for participating in it&#x2014;indeed, dying for it&#x2014;that is the central and most cherishable quality of the biography.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joan Acocella, <i>New Yorker<br> <br></i>&#x201c;Rowland tells this great story in moving, vivid prose, concentrating as much on Bruno&#x2019;s thought as on his life. . . .

Just over life size, clutching a book in manacled hands, he glowers over the marketplace of Campo de&#x2019; Fiori, the "Field of Flowers" that was also, for many years, one of the city&#x2019;s execution grounds. The statue was meant to point in the opposite direction, facing the sun, but a last-minute decision by the City Council of Rome in 1889 turned it around to face the Vatican, which had complained that the original placement was disrespectful. Because of this change in position, the friar&#x2019;s face is always shadowed, so that he looks more melancholy than defiant. But then, he is a man condemned to die by burning at the stake; he has every reason to be melancholy. </p><p>For at least five hundred years, Roman statues have been champions of free speech; three blocks from the Campo de&#x2019; Fiori, an ancient marble wreck of two torsos and a noseless head named Mastro Pasquino has been papered with acid comments on Roman life ever since the first years of the sixteenth century. From satires of the Borgia pope, Alexander VI, he has moved on to hurling invectives against the current prime minister, and for many years a spray-painted feminist graffito on his base proclaimed him Pasquina.</p><p>Down the street in the other direction, a togaed ancient Roman called Abbot Luigi (Abate Luigi) has been talking nearly as long as Pasquino; the removal of his grizzled old head by a thief in the 1970s failed to stop his chatter, and he has long since been recapitated with the portrait of some other stern old senator, one no less pleased to speak his mind without inhibition to latter-day Romans. The friar in the Campo de&#x2019; Fiori makes a worthy companion to this vocal pair, and to their more distant colleagues Madama Lucrezia and Marforio, both of whom, sadly, have been dumbstruck by modern life: Madama Lucrezia may have begun as the cult image of Isis in ancient Rome&#x2019;s most elaborate Egyptian temple, but she now lords it over a bus stop in Piazza Venezia, while handsome Marforio, a strapping Roman river god, is shut up in the Capitoline Museum, where no one can reach him any longer to give him a paper voice. Instead, Giordano Bruno, the friar of Campo de&#x2019; Fiori, must now speak for them both. And he does, in letters of bronze on his granite pedestal: "To Bruno, from the generation he foresaw, here, where the pyre burned."</p><p>That generation, the first student generation of the newly created Italian state, commissioned the statue in the 1880s from the sculptor Ettore Ferrari, supported by an international subscription campaign. Italy&#x2019;s formation had hinged on seizing political control of Rome and its territories from the governmental dominion of the papacy, and hence the monument to Bruno thumbed its nose at the pope with spectacular impudence by paying tribute to one of the Inquisition&#x2019;s most illustrious victims&#x2014;and reminded the Vatican just why this new Italy had chosen so eagerly to become a secular state. </p><p>The Roman students chose Bruno as their patron martyr not only for his bravery but also for his ideas; more boldly than anyone in his age, including Kepler and Galileo, he had declared that the universe was made of atoms and that it was infinite in size. His violent, public death for those convictions showed the Catholic Church in its most cruelly repressive light, for Bruno had not been a political man, nor had he committed any crime except to speak his mind. For the students of a new Italy and a newly independent Rome, the statue was meant to prove that ideas can and must prevail over the attempt to stifle them. </p><p>To this day, then, on the morning of February 17, a contingent from City Hall places a wreath at the bronze Bruno&#x2019;s feet, its laurel leaves draped in red and gold ribbons, the initials "SPQR"embossed in gold letters. By laying a wreath at Bruno&#x2019;s feet, the mayor of Rome continues to assert the modern city&#x2019;s independence from a temporal Church. The process usually displaces an early drinker or two, and as floral offerings pile up around the wreath, together with poems, candles, and invectives, they stay displaced. Late in the afternoon, when the market stalls have been taken down and squirreled away in side streets, the Italian Association of Free Thinkers sets up a microphone at Bruno&#x2019;s feet; meanwhile, the atheists and the pantheists, carefully separated from each other, lay out their tables of books and leaflets on opposite sides of the piazza. In between them, the Free Thinkers guard their microphone jealously, wresting it in turn from the man in the sandwich board who claims to be Giordano Bruno incarnate, from the tipplers who use the statue&#x2019;s base as a convenient perch, from the students, artists, and enthusiasts who think&#x2014;wrongly, as it turns out&#x2014;that free thought implies free speech. This microphone is only for organizations, the Free Thinkers declare to all their competitors for the space beneath Giordano&#x2019;s lowering gaze: the Masons, the atheists, and the pantheists, all of whom claim the hooded friar as their very own spiritual leader. Brooding and silent above the fray, steadfast above the dispute between the believers in no god and the believers in all gods, the bronze Giordano Bruno glares at the distant Vatican, which put the real Giordano Bruno to death here in the Campo de&#x2019; Fiori on February 17, 1600, for obstinate and pertinacious heresy. </p><p>By evening, Ettore Ferrari&#x2019;s statue will be covered with offerings, as if Giordano Bruno were a miracle-working saint rather than a condemned heretic. </p><p>Since the statue&#x2019;s dedication, Bruno&#x2019;s reputation has undergone several new transformations. If late-nineteenth-century Italians saw him as an apostle of modern science, a pair of mid-twentieth-century scholars at the Warburg Institute in London, Frances Yates and D. P. Walker, recast him as a religious reformer, a mystic, and a practitioner of magic; Giovanni Aquilecchia, their younger contemporary in London, waited years to see Bruno the magician give way to more general acceptance of his own view of Bruno as a philosopher. However diverse their portraits of Bruno, Yates and Aquilecchia were both remarkable writers and teachers who drew a surprisingly wide range of new readers to the Italian heretic. In the mid-1980s, Bruno was still regarded as a marginal figure, and only a handful of books had been dedicated to him since the great burst of interest in the late nineteenth century; a decade later, Giordano had acquired his own periodical, <i>Bruniana &amp; Campanelliana</i>, several institutions (including a convent of Dominican nuns in Utrecht) bearing his name, and a remarkable degree of public interest that culminated in widespread commemorations of the four hundredth anniversary of his death&#x2014;which coincided, by a four-hundred-year-old design, with the great jubilee proclaimed for the Catholic Church by Pope John Paul II. (Bruno&#x2019;s burning had been deliberately set by Pope Clement VIII for the jubilee of 1600.) In recent years, the people who leave flowers on the statue in Campo de&#x2019; Fiori (and not only on February 17) come from around the world. Their interests in Bruno range as widely as his own writings, from pragmatic observation to rapturous mysticism, from appreciation of his complex prose to uncomplicated admiration for his courage in the defense of free thought.</p><p>Ferrari&#x2019;s heroic, imposing Bruno is anything but realistic: Bruno had not worn a Dominican habit for twenty-four years when he was marched off to the stake; indeed, as a final indignity, he was stripped naked before he burned. There are no surviving portraits of the gaunt little man who by that time had spent eight years in inquisitorial prison, only a report of his fierce expression; Ferrari&#x2019;s robust image reflects the man&#x2019;s spirit, not his body. And its placement obeys the laws of urban design rather than historical accuracy: Bruno died in the southwest corner of the piazza, toward Piazza Farnese, not its center, despite the statue&#x2019;s declaration "Here, where the pyre burned."Somber as it is, Ferrari&#x2019;s hooded friar has succeeded so well because he captures the sheer challenge that Bruno posed for his times, a challenge that has lost none of its power since 1600, or 1889. The devout Galileo has been rehabilitated by the church that condemned him to silence in 1633; his offending <i>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</i> was reprinted with papal approval as early as 1712, and he was officially pardoned by Pope John Paul II in 1983. But as the anniversary of Bruno&#x2019;s death loomed over the Roman jubilee year of 2000, John Paul declared, through two cardinals, Angelo Sodano and Paul Poupard, that Bruno had deviated too far from Christian doctrine to be granted Christian pardon. The inquisitors who put the philosopher to his gruesome death, the cardinals added, should be judged in the light of their gruesome times. As Sodano noted, in what was obviously a carefully worded document: "It is not our place to express judgments about the conscience of those who were involved in this matter. Objectively, nonetheless, certain aspects of these procedures and in particular their violent result at the hand of civil authority, in this and analogous cases, cannot but constitute a cause for profound regret on the part of the Church."</p><p>As a child of those same gruesome times, Giordano Bruno asserted that in the end even the devils would be pardoned and that religious strife, with its human claim to see through God&#x2019;s eyes, was the most misguided strife of all. Despite the optimism of the Roman students who erected his monument in Campo de&#x2019; Fiori, in many respects the generation he foresaw still belongs to the future.</p><p>Bruno poses no less formidable a challenge to historians of science. Working without instrumentation, posing thought problems that reflected both ancient and modern ideas about natural philosophy, he fits uncomfortably into any scheme that aims to trace scientific thought in a neat line from Copernicus through Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein. He was, perhaps, more of a poet than an empirical observer. Yet his intellectual contradictions, his blind spots, and his insights serve as a reminder that scientific investigation has always depended on inspiration as well as investigation, on mistakes as well as triumphs.</p><p>Above all, Giordano Bruno defies any kind of summary judgment; his life, his ideas, and his personality are as complex as his times are distant from our own. He could be charming or infuriating, charismatic or repellent. For all his faults, however, he was brave and brilliant, and, as these pages aim to show, he was a splendid writer. </p><p>Excerpted from Giordano Bruno by Ingrid D.

Reprint.</p><p>There is a pathway to richness in marriage outside the traditional marriage enrichment approach. Many excellent books have been written that tell how to build a better marriage; Sacred Marriage, on the other hand, shows how marriage can contribute to a better spiritual life. Blending quotes from Christian classics and true-life anecdotes from his seminars, author and speaker Gary Thomas helps readers reframe their concept of marriage. While marriage may not be the only tool that can help people draw closer to God, it is a powerful one. It reveals our character--who we really are--and trains us to become who we want to be. The marital relationship offers a context for lasting and significant spiritual growth; it provides fertile ground for cultivating humility, perseverance, charity, forgiveness, confession, prayer, non-judgmentalism, and more. Sacred Marriage is not about marriage-transformation, or spouse-transformation, but about self-transformation. It is not about loving one&#39;s mate better, although that will be an inevitable outcome. Rather, this book is written to help the reader love God more and reflect the character of his Son at an ever-deepening level--not because any marriage is ever perfect, but because it helps husbands and wives discover and revel in their relationship with God.Gary Thomas is a writer and the founder and director of the Center for Evangelical Spirituality, a ministry that integrates Scripture, church history, and the Christian classics. He has written several books, including Sacred Pathways, chosen by World Magazine as one of the top ten books of 1996.

There is special emphasis on the phenomenological approach. This approach requires that the caregiver adopts a perspective that leads to a more human and responsive understanding of each child. This approach is combined with the scientific methodology allowing the caregiver to achieve a level of improved competence, becoming reflective practitioners. There is careful consideration of cultural differences in the book due to the ever present and increasing diversity of the US population. This allows the caregiver to be fully aware of how culture, beliefs, and traditions can influence the ultimate development of a child. The early chapters describe the philosophy of the book and explain various methods of observation. They also provide a baseline of information on growth and development. Further chapters focus on development in 3 month spans, leading to the full examination of how children grow and change rapidly in all domains: physical, emotional, social, cognitive, and language. Developmental variations and alerts are considered at each level, including health and safety issues as well as potential signs of abuse and neglect. The book includes multiple learning tools including key terms and words of wisdom, as well as an online companion. The reader will benefit fully from this thoughtful reference based in the acknowledgment that all children are competent and powerful learners.</p><p>Jennifer Berke received her undergraduate degree in elementary education from Syracuse University and taught first grade for the Syracuse City School District for three years.

Not until the nineteenth century would three astronomers, armed with the best telescopes of the age, race to conquer this astronomical Everest&#x2014;their contest ending in a virtual dead heat. <br><br>Against a sweeping backdrop filled with kidnappings, dramatic rescue, swordplay, madness, and bitter rivalry, Alan Hirshfeld brings to life the heroes of this remarkable story. Meet the destitute boy plucked from a collapsed building who becomes the greatest telescope maker the world has ever seen; the hot-tempered Dane whose nose is lopped off in a duel over mathematics; the merchant&#x2019;s apprentice forced to choose between the lure of money and his passion for astronomy; and the musician who astounds the world by discovering a new planet from his own backyard. <br><br>Generously illustrated with diagrams, period engravings, and paintings, <i>Parallax</i> is an unforgettable tale that illuminates the distinctly human side of science.<br></p><p>&#x201c;Alan Hirshfeld's PARALLAX succinctly tells one of the great stories of scientific history in an exciting and readable manner. Written in the genre of Dava Sobel's Longitude, Hirshfeld sheds light on the important problem of finding our cosmic place.&#x201d; &#x2014; David H. Levy, Science Editor, Parade, and discoverer of 21 comets <p>&#x201c;For 2000 years, astronomers knew how to measure the distance to the stars but couldn't quite pull it off. The stars, of course, turned out to be frustratingly far away. Alan Hirshfeld's authoritative and gripping tale of the search for stellar parallax makes me proud to a part of such a relentlessly curious and persistent species.&#x201d; &#x2014; Chet Raymo, columnist, Boston Globe, and author of 365 STARRY NIGHTS </p><p>&#x201c;In this thrilling history of the search for parallax, Hirshfeld urges us to "fly together." We are carried along on a wave of excitement from the first wild notion of Aristarchus in the third century B.C. to the final triumph of Friedrich Bessel in 1838. Hirshfeld's own awe and delight in his stories of discovery are captivating and often personal&#x2014;"Join me as I cut through my neighbor's yard...and set up my telescope." The human failures and frustrations and the crucial discoveries in the quest for parallax are as thrilling as the story of the determination of longitude, and just as important.&#x201d; &#x2014; Jane Langton , author of two astronomical mystery novels, DARK NANTUCKET NOON and THE SHORTEST DAY. </p><p>&#x201c;With this highly readable and cosmically accessible book, Alan Hirshfeld has done for the measurement of the cosmos what Dava Sobel did for the measurement of longitude. Now that our ships are plying the heavens as they once did the seas, the story of how we came to calculate cosmic distances looms large on our historical horizon. There is nothing grander than the universe, and Hirshfeld is to be commended for bringing it down to size for us all to see.

It&#x2019;s also a favorite of p�tissiers and dessert chefs. Michael Roux--for many years a chef at the top of his profession and a global traveler with a passion for different cuisines--is the ideal author to take a new look at one of the oldest foods of all.<p>Each chapter is based around a style of cooking eggs, from boiling, frying ,poaching, baking and scrambling, to making the perfect omelet, cr�pe, souffl�, meringue and custard. Classic recipes such as Hollandaise Sauce, Eggs Benedict and Lemon Souffl� are given a modern twist, while Michel&#x2019;s original recipes boast new combinations of flavors or a lighter, simpler style of cooking. Illustrated with 150 stunning photographs and designed in a clear, modern, easy-to-follow style, <i>Eggs</i> is set to become a classic.</p></p><p>Michel Roux is one of the most highly acclaimed chefs in the world, who has held three Michelin stars at The Waterside Inn near Windsor in England for an astonishing 21 years.

(<i>New York Times</i>, Dining In/Dining Out Section, June 7, 2006)<p>You are not likely to find gull's eggs, spring delicacies in England, in these parts, but even the mention of them in "Eggs" by Michel Roux gives you an idea of how comprehensive this alluring book is. It covers just about every aspect of the egg, including its chemistry, safety, storage and flavor, and each page is beautifully photographed.<br>Mr. Roux, a Michelin three-star chef in England, provides recipes that begin with the simplest boiled eggs, for which there are dozens of variations, and include a delectably velvety French toast casserole with cheese and herbs that would glorify an Easter brunch.<br>His trick for frying eggs so that the white is crunchy and envelops the runny yolk is a keeper, and lovely served in potato nest. There are recipes for omlets, frittatas, custards, mousses and much more, making a rich collection indeed.&#x2014;Tony Cenicola (<i>The New York Times</i>, April 12, 2006)</p></p><h2>Burtons Legal Thesaurus 5th edition: Over 10,000 Synonyms, Terms, and Expressions Specifically Related to the Legal Profession</h2><p>THE FIRST AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL THESAURUS EVER PUBLISHED Updated with 1,000 essential new terms-- ranging from "whistleblower,"&nbsp; "bailout," "fiscal cliff,&nbsp;and "cyberbullying," to "pyramid scheme," "inside information,"&nbsp;"perfect storm,""fracking," and "hacking."<br>The first book of its kind when it was orginally published in 1980, <i>Burton's Legal Thesaurus</i> has become a staple for everyone in the legal profession.

I wouldn't stand there and give you a lecture about aperture, exposure, and depth of field. In real life, I'd just say, 'Get out your telephoto lens, set your f/stop to f/2.8, focus on the flower, and fire away.' You d say, 'OK,' and you'd get the shot. That's what this book is all about. A book of you and I shooting, and I answer the questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I've learned just like I would with a friend, without all the technical explanations and without all the techno-photo-speak."<br> <br> This isn't a book of theory&#x2014;it isn't full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts: this is a book of which button to push, which setting to use, when to use them, and nearly two hundred of the most closely guarded photographic "tricks of the trade" to get you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos with your digital camera every time you press the shutter button.<br> <br> Here's another thing that makes this book different: each page covers just one trick, just one single concept that makes your photography better. Every time you turn the page, you'll learn another pro setting, another pro tool, another pro trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. There's never been a book like it, and if you're tired of taking shots that look "OK," and if you&#x2019;re tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, "Why don't my shots look like that?" then this is the book for you.</p><p><b>Scott Kelby </b>is President of the <b>National Association of Photoshop Professionals </b>(NAPP) and Editor-in-Chief of both <b>Photoshop User and Layers </b>magazines.

This book explores the resonances of gay, lesbian and queer experience in American culture, particularly in the past thirty years.<br>In a Different Light engages a range of queer issues, aesthetic concerns, and formal styles. Instead of inquiring "What does lesbian or gay art look like?" the curators ask: "How are queer artists looking at the world?" This is the first time that a major American museum has considered this important subject in a broad cross-generational context. The inclusion of literary work in the context of this exhibition catalog brings into focus the relationships between artists and writers in lesbian and gay culture, the interaction of genres and media in these representations, and the impact of visual culture - the arts, popular iconography, advertising, and style - on the formation of identity.</p><p></p><h2>Emergency Procedures for the Small Animal Veterinarian</h2><p>The 2nd Edition of this popular reference provides all of the information needed to form a diagnosis quickly and accurately, establish a prognosis, and recommend treatment for a patient suffering an illness, injury or toxic event.</p><p>Signe Plunkett, D.V.M., Emergency Animal Clinic, Phoenix, AZ"Overall, this is a nice book to have as a reference.

Other sites emerged for the generation of art, leading to the idea of &#x201c;post-studio practice.&#x201d; But the studio never went away; it was continually reinvented in response to new realities. This collection, expanding on current critical interest in issues of production and situation, looks at the evolution of studio&#x2015;and &#x201c;post-studio&#x201d;&#x2015;practice over the last half century.</p><p>In recent decades many artists have turned their studios into offices from which they organize a multiplicity of operations and interactions. Others use the studio as a quasi-exhibition space, or work on a laptop computer&#x2015;mobile, flexible, and ready to follow the next commission.</p><p>Among the topics surveyed here are the changing portrayal and experience of the artist's role since 1960; the diversity of current studio and post-studio practice; the critical strategies of artists who have used the studio situation as the subject or point of origin for their work; the insights to be gained from archival studio projects; and the expanded field of production that arises from responding to new conditions in the world outside the studio. The essays and artists' statements in this volume explore these questions with a focus on examining the studio's transition from a workshop for physical production to a space with potential for multiple forms of creation and participation.</p></p><p>Jens Hoffmann is Director of the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco, and Curator of the 12th Istanbul Biennial.

For even as she sets out to determine how big "really big" may be, Levin gives us an intimate look at the day-to-day life of a globe-trotting physicist, complete with jet lag and romantic disturbances. <p></p>Nimbly synthesizing geometry, topology, chaos and string theories, Levin shows how the pattern of hot and cold spots left over from the big bang may one day reveal the size and shape of the cosmos. She does so with such originality, lucidity--and even poetry--that <b>How the Universe Got Its Spots</b> becomes a thrilling and deeply personal communication between a scientist and the lay reader.</p><p>"[Levin] covers ... fascinating ground....She writes passages that may make you either feel claustrophobic for only living in three visible dimensions or see the night sky in an entirely new way." <i>--Baltimore City Paper<br></i><br> "Science as it is lived....

No other scientist has yet had the courage to write such an honest and personal account of what it is like to live the life of a scientist."<b>--Lee Smolin, author of <i>The Life of the Cosmos</i> and <i>Three Roads to Quantum Gravity</i><br> </b><br> </p><br> <p>"This is a totally charming piece of work. A memoir of one very talented young woman, it layers her personal odyssey and bits of science like an exotic piece of intellectual/personal pastry. The attitude toward the subject is that of the artist: feelings matter, pictures matter, intuitions matter. Levin's book is a wonderful read that introduces current science from an odd angle in a lively, accessible, and engaging fashion. I have never read a book like it."<b>--Jeremiah P.

However, as Durba Ghosh argues in a challenge to the existing historiography, anxieties about social status, appropriate sexuality, and the question of who could be counted as &#39;British&#39; or &#39;Indian&#39; were constant concerns of the colonial government even at this time. By following the stories of a number of mixed-race families, at all levels of the social scale, from high-ranking officials and noblewomen to rank-and-file soldiers and camp followers, and also the activities of indigenous female concubines, mistresses and wives, the author offers a fascinating account of how gender, class and race affected the cultural, social and even political mores of the period.

QUATIERI</b> is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, MA. He is involved in digital signal processing for speech and audio modification, coding, enhancement, and speaker recognition, and he developed MIT's graduate course in Digital Speech Processing. Quatieri's publications and papers include <i>Speech Analysis/Synthesis Based on a Sinusoidal Representation</i>, winner of the 1990 IEEE Signal Processing Society's Senior Award, and <i>Energy Separation in Signal Modulations with Application to Speech Analysis</i>, winner of the 1994 IEEE Signal Processing Society's Senior Award and the 1995 IEEE W.R.G.

As such, principles are never too distant from practice; theory is often followed by applications, both past and present. This text is also an outgrowth of my childhood wonder in the blending of signal and symbol processing, sound, and technology. I first felt this fascination in communicating with two cans coupled by twine, in playing with a toy Morse code, and in adventuring through old ham radio equipment in my family's basement. My goals in this book are to provide an intensive tutorial on the principles of discrete-time speech signal processing, to describe the state-of-the-art in speech signal processing research and its applications, and to pass on to the reader my continued wonder for this rapidly evolving field.</p><p>The text consists of fourteen chapters that are outlined in detail in Chapter 1. The "theory" component of the book falls within Chapters 2-11, while Chapters 12-14 consist primarily of the application areas of speech coding and enhancement, and speaker recognition. Other applications are introduced throughout Chapters 2-11, such as speech modification, noise reduction, signal restoration, and dynamic range compression. A broader range of topics that include speech and language recognition is not covered; to do so would result in a survey book that does not fill the current need in this field. The style of the text is to show not only when speech modeling and processing methods succeed, but also to describe limitations of the methods. This style makes the reader question established ideas and reveals where advancement is needed. An important tenet in this book is that anomaly in observation is crucial for advancement; as reflected by the late philosopher Thomas Kuhn: "Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science."1</p><p>The text body is strongly supplemented with examples and exercises. Each exercise set contains a number of MATLAB problems that provide hands-on experience with speech signals and processing methods. Scripts, workspaces, and signals, required for the MATLAB exercises, are located on the Prentice Hall companion website (phptr/quatieri/). Also on this website are audio demonstrations that illustrate a variety of principles and applications from each chapter, including time-scale modification of the phrase "as time goes by" shown on the front cover of this book. The book is structured so that application areas that are not covered as separate topics are either presented as examples or exercises, e.g., speaker separation by sinusoidal modeling and restoration of old acoustic recordings by homomorphic processing. In my MIT speech processing course, I found this approach to be very effective, especially since such examples and exercises are fascinating demonstrations of the theory and can provide a glimpse of state-of-the-art applications.</p><p>The book is also structured so that topics can be covered on different levels of depth and breadth. For example, a one-semester course on discrete-time speech signal processing could be taught with an emphasis on fundamentals using Chapters 2-9. To focus on the speech coding application, one can include Chapter 12, but also other applications as examples and exercises. In a two-semester course, greater depth could be given to fundamentals in the first semester, using Chapters 2-9. In the second semester, a focus could then be given to advanced theories and applications of Chapters 10-14, with supplementary material on speech recognition.</p></p><h2>Cardiac Surgery Essentials for Critical Care Nursing</h2><p>Cardiac Surgery Essentials for Critical Care Nursing, Second Edition is an indispensable reference for new and experienced nurses caring for patients in intensive care units immediately following cardiac surgery.

In communing with the natural world, he wished to "live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what it had to teach." Toward that end Thoreau built a cabin in the spring of 1845 on the shores of Walden Pond on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson outside Concord, Massachusetts. There he observed nature, farmed, built fences, surveyed, and wrote in his journal.<br>One product of his two-year sojourn was this book a great classic of American letters. Interwoven with accounts of Thoreau's daily life (he received visitors and almost daily walked into Concord) are mediations on human existence, society, government, and other topics, expressed with wisdom and beauty of style.<br><i>Walden</i> offers abundant evidence of Thoreau's ability to begin with observations on a mundane incident or the minutiae of nature and then develop these observations into profound ruminations on the most fundamental human concerns. Credited with influencing Tolstoy, Gandhi, and other thinkers, the volume remains a masterpiece of philosophical reflection."</p><h2>Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters</h2><p>Abe and his friend Sol are out for a walk together in a part of town they haven't been in before. Passing a Christian church, they notice a curious sign in front that says "$1,000 to anyone who will convert." "I wonder what that's about," says Abe. "I think I'll go in and have a look. I'll be back in a minute; just wait for me."<br><br>Sol sits on the sidewalk bench and waits patiently for nearly half an hour. Finally, Abe reappears.<br><br>"Well," asks Sol, "what are they up to? Who are they trying to convert? Why do they care? Did you get the $1,000?"<br><br>Indignantly Abe replies, "Money. That's all you people care about."<br><br>Ted Cohen thinks that's not a bad joke. But he also doesn't think it's an easy joke. For a listener or reader to laugh at Abe's conversion, a complicated set of conditions must be met. First, a listener has to recognize that Abe and Sol are Jewish names. Second, that listener has to be familiar with the widespread idea that Jews are more interested in money than anything else. And finally, the listener needs to know this information in advance of the joke, and without anyone telling him or her. Jokes, in short, are complicated transactions in which communities are forged, intimacy is offered, and otherwise offensive stereotypes and cliches lose their sting&#x2014;at least sometimes.<br><br><i>Jokes</i> is a book of jokes and a book about them. Cohen loves a good laugh, but as a philosopher, he is also interested in how jokes work, why they work, and when they don't. The delight at the end of a joke is the result of a complex set of conditions and processes, and Cohen takes us through these conditions in a philosophical exploration of humor. He considers questions of audience, selection of joke topics, the ethnic character of jokes, and their morality, all with plenty of examples that will make you either chuckle or wince. <i>Jokes:</i> more humorous than other philosophy books, more philosophical than other humor books.<br><br>"Befitting its subject, this study of jokes is . . . light, funny, and thought-provoking. . . .

At the same time it has been significantly updated and modernized for today's engineering students and professional engineers. <p>Working from extensive market research and reviews of the 6th edition, the new 7th edition features reduced coverage of uncertainty and statistical methods. Statistics is now treated (in chapter 2) as one of several methods available to design engineers, and statistical applications are no longer integrated throughout the text, examples and problem sets. </p><p>Other major changes include updated coverage of the design process, streamlined coverage of statistics, a more practical overview of materials and materials selection (moved to chapter 3), revised coverage of failure and fatigue, and review of basic strength of materials topics to make a clearer link with prerequisite courses. </p><p> Overall coverage of basic concepts has been made more clear and concise, with some advanced topics deleted, so that readers can easily navigate key topics. Problem sets have been improved, with new problems added to help students progressively work through them. </p><p>The book has an Online Learning Center with several powerful components: MATLAB for Machine Design (featuring highly visual MATLAB simulations and accompanying source code); the "FEPC" finite element program, with accompanying Finite Element Primer and FEM Tutorials; interactive FE Exam questions for Machine Design; and Machine Design Tutorials for study of key concepts from Parts I and II of the text.

Like the best modernist fiction, <i>Ripley</i> works on two levels. First, it is the story of a young man, Tom Ripley, whose nihilistic tendencies lead him on a deadly passage across Europe. On another level, the novel is a commentary on fictionmaking and techniques of narrative persuasion. Like Humbert Humbert, Tom Ripley seduces readers into empathizing with him even as his actions defy all moral standards.<p> The novel begins with a play on James's <i>The Ambassadors</i>. Tom Ripley is chosen by the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf to retrieve Greenleaf's son, Dickie, from his overlong sojourn in Italy. Dickie, it seems, is held captive both by the Mediterranean climate and the attractions of his female companion, but Mr. Greenleaf needs him back in New York to help with the family business. With an allowance and a new purpose, Tom leaves behind his dismal city apartment to begin his career as a return escort. But Tom, too, is captivated by Italy. He is also taken with the life and looks of Dickie Greenleaf. He insinuates himself into Dickie's world and soon finds that his passion for a lifestyle of wealth and sophistication transcends moral compunction. Tom will become Dickie Greenleaf--at all costs.</p><p> Unlike many modernist experiments, <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i> is eminently readable and is driven by a gripping chase narrative that chronicles each of Tom's calculated maneuvers of self-preservation. Highsmith was in peak form with this novel, and her ability to enter the mind of a sociopath and view the world through his disturbingly amoral eyes is a model that has spawned such latter-day serial killers as Hannibal Lecter. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>"[Highsmith] has created a world of her own--a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger." --Graham Greene<br><br>"Patricia Highsmith's novels are peerlessly disturing . . . bad dreams that keep us thrashing for the rest of the night, with the sense that an awful possibility has been articulated only to be left unresolved." --<b>The New Yorker</b><br><br>"One of our greatest modernist writers." --Gore Vidal</p><h2>The Dragonfly Effect: Quick, Effective, and Powerful Ways To Use Social Media to Drive Social Change</h2><p><b>Proven strategies for harnessing the power of social media to drive social change</b> <p>Many books teach the mechanics of using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to compete in business. But no book addresses how to harness the incredible power of social media to make a difference. <i>The Dragonfly Effect</i> shows you how to tap social media and consumer psychological insights to achieve a single, concrete goal.

We named it after the only insect that can move swiftly in any direction, and even hover, when its four wings are moving in harmony. The four &#x201c;wings&#x201d; of the model&#x2014;Focus, Grab Attention, Engage, and Take Action&#x2014;work together to help readers produce the change they seek, and that desired change can take many forms: social good, employee morale, or customer loyalty, among many others. <p></p> The name itself is a tribute to the &#x201c;Butterfly Effect,&#x201d; which is itself built on chaos theory. It describes how the flapping of a butterfly&#x2019;s wings might have an impact on the weather halfway around the world. The dragonfly, however, moves with tremendous speed and force, and compared to a butterfly, it has about twenty times more power in each flap of its wings. You can imagine that potential is even greater when harnessed and coordinated on a mass scale. Al Gore, former vice president and master viral-message maker, once said, &#x201c;If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.&#x201d; Small acts create big change, and working in concert maximizes your ability to go farther faster&#x2014;and in any direction you choose. <p></p> <b>What inspired you to create this movement (or ecosystem)? </b><br> There were three underlying reasons we started working this book: first, Andy&#x2019;s experience in marketing and harnessing social media to build brands suggested that the social space could be deployed in a fundamentally new way; second, Jennifer&#x2019;s research on happiness, which shows that what people think makes them happy isn&#x2019;t really what makes them happy; and third, most importantly, our own personal experience working with amazing, smart people to find a bone marrow match for a friend, which, as a result, helped to build up a bone marrow registry that&#x2019;s helped thousands of others. Those stories, and the tools that were developed as a result, are described in this book. <p></p> These three things led to &#x201c;The Power of Social Technology,&#x201d; a class that Jennifer teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The class is designed to help entrepreneurial students harness the social web to cultivate good in the world. The course demonstrates not only that people are clamoring for ways to use the social web for good, but that there&#x2019;s a framework and a repeatable process that can help them achieve their goals quickly. We wanted to share this model with as many people as possible and are excited to see what can be achieved as even more people get involved. <p></p> <b>Lots of books describe how to use social media. How is yours different? </b><br> That&#x2019;s true; there are many excellent books that teach the mechanics of using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. And some explain how to use these tools to compete in business. But few books address how to harness the incredible power of the social web to make a difference. <i>The Dragonfly Effect</i> shows you how to tap social media and insights from consumer psychology to achieve a single, concrete goal. We walk readers through the Obama campaign and how they pioneered social technology strategies to create political change; how Starbucks uses the social web to engage with customers and educate fans about social-good initiatives, such as buying fair trade coffee; how ProFounder provides a platform for crowdfunding for small businesses, making micro-loans easily available to entrepreneurs; and how everyday people are able to improve the chance of survival for cancer patients. <p></p> We also have direct insights from the founders of eBay&#x2019;s World of Good, storytellers from Pixar, and leaders from Facebook, Twitter, and Google...all offering their unique expertise and success stories. Throughout the book, readers will also find Dragonfly Toolkits designed to break down potentially intimidating first-steps and walk them through the process of getting started with easy-to-implement actions. <p></p> <b>What do you mean by &#x201c;the ripple effect&#x201d; and &#x201c;emotional contagion&#x201d;? </b><br> Just as a rock thrown into a pond leads to a series of waves that radiate in all directions, the small act that you do can lead to big, often unimaginable results. Research shows that ripple effects result from small acts that have a positive significant impact on others over time. When the action at the epicenter of the ripple effect is based on deep meaning (or something that you believe will make you happy), a multiplier effect can occur because of principles of emotional contagion. <p></p> <i>Emotional contagion</i> is the tendency to feel emotions similar to and otherwise be influenced by the emotions of others. So when others around you start to feel the way you do, they can become more strongly energized and mobilized. The fact that your feelings of happiness or meaning can actually infect others also helps explain why some initiatives work and others don't. It underscores the potential for organizations of all types to cultivate social good&#x2014;which is often tied to happiness and meaning&#x2014;when they&#x2019;re trying to capture the imagination of their employees and customers. <p></p>"<i>The Dragonfly Effect</i> is the single best road map to social media I have ever seen. With ideas rooted in research and examples rooted in life, it offers both big strategies and small tips that you can use to invigorate your business, increase your happiness, and maybe even change the world.

Gathered here is a significant body of information currently available only in widely scattered sources. The 261 alphabetically arranged entries span a broad spectrum of topics, embracing major themes in folk culture and the legends and sagas of classic European literature both oral and written dating from 500 to 1500 C.E. (Only very modest attention is paid to materials from Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.) Each essay first defines the topic and then carefully addresses context, historical development, uses, motifs, and notable research. Major entries cover death, dance, music, Christmas, lesbians, funeral rituals, taverns, spirits, food, and animals in literatures from Baltic to Welsh to Jewish. Penned by 114 academic scholars, both European and American, the narratives are often ponderous and leaden, yet it must be acknowledged that within academic limits the writing is well crafted, offering insights and dimension found nowhere else. While not exhaustive, this is an extensive and fully researched work that scholars will find valuable. Richard K.

Beyond lay a world of which they had only the haziest impressions. The belief that Christian communities were to be found here was nurtured in the 12th century by the growth of the legend of Prester John; but otherwise Asia was peopled in the Western imagination by monstrous races borrowed from the works of late Antiquity. The rise of the Mongol empire, however, and the Mongol devastation of Hungary and Poland in 1241-2, brought the West into much closer contact with Inner Asia. Embassies were being exchanged with the Mongols from 1245; Italian merchants began to profit from the commercial opportunities offered by the union of much of Asia under a single power; and the newly emerging orders of preaching friars, the Franciscans and the Dominicans, who had been active in Eastern Europe and in the Islamic world since the 1220s, found their field of operations greatly expanded. The Franciscan William of Rubruck, who travelled through the Mongol empire in 1253-55, composed the earliest report of such a missionary journey that has come down to us. Couched in the form of a long letter to the French king Louis IX, this remarkable document constitutes an extremely valuable source on the Mongols during the era of their greatness. Rubruck was also the first Westerner to make contact with Buddhism, to describe the shamanistic practices by which the Mongols and other steppe peoples set such store, and to make detailed observations on the Nestorian Christian church and its rites. His remarks on geography, ethnography and fauna (notably the ovis poli, which he encountered a generation before the more celebrated Venetian adventurer from whom it takes its scientific name) give him an additional claim to be one of the keenest of medieval European observers to have travelled in Asia. This new annotated translation is designed to supersede that of W.W. Rockhill, published by the Society in 1900, by relating Rubruck&#39;s testimony to the wealth of material on Mongol Asia that has become accessible in other sources over the past nine decades.</p><p>Translated by Peter Jackson.

He was constitutionally incapable of writing with the opacity of the specialist, but these shorter, more introductory pieces provide the perfect starting-point for the reader new to his work. Those who are already familiar with his writing will also be grateful for this further addition to his collected essays.</p><br><p> The connecting theme of these essays, as in the case of earlier volumes, is the crucial social and political role--past, present and future--of ideas, and of their progenitors. A rich variety of subject-matters is represented--from philosophy to education, from Russia to Israel, from Marxism to romanticism--so that the truth of Heine's warning is exemplified on a broad front. It is a warning that Berlin often referred to, and provides an answer to those who ask, as from time to time they do, why intellectual history matters.</p><br><p> Among the contributions are "My Intellectual Path," Berlin's last essay, a retrospective autobiographical survey of his main preoccupations; and "Jewish Slavery and Emancipation," the classic statement of his Zionist views, long unavailable in print. His other subjects include the Enlightenment, Giambattista Vico, Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Herzen, G.V. Plekhanov, the Russian intelligentsia, the idea of liberty, political realism, nationalism, and historicism. The book exhibits the full range of his enormously wide expertise and demonstrates the striking and enormously engaging individuality, as well as the power, of his own ideas.</p><br><p> "Over a hundred years ago, the German poet Heine warned the French not to underestimate the power of ideas: philosophical concepts nurtured in the stillness of a professor's study could destroy a civilization."--Isaiah Berlin, <i>Two Concepts of Liberty</i>, 1958</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Power of Ideas</i> ... captures, in crystalline fashion, not just the power of ideas in history but the utility of Berlin's own ideas in understanding what is happening today in the world."<b>--Strobe Talbott, author of<i>At the Highest Levels: The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War</i></b></p><b>Isaiah Berlin</b> was, until his death in 1997, a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

The study established Carlyle&#39;s reputation and contains portraits of Mirabeau, Lafayette, Danton and Robespierre. This edition reproduces the two-volume text of 1857 and includes a new chronology of events of the Revolution and a full index, as well as informative notes.</p><p>The book that established Thomas Carlyle's reputation when first published in 1837, this spectacular historical masterpiece has since been accepted as the standard work on the subject. It combines a shrewd insight into character, a vivid realization of the picturesque, and a singular ability to bring the past to blazing life, making it a reading experience as thrilling as any novel. As John D. Rosenberg observes in his Introduction, "The French Revolution is "one of the grand poems of [Carlyle's] century, yet its poetry consists in being everywhere scrupulously rooted in historical fact." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition, complete and unabridged, is unavailable anywhere else.French Revolution</p><h2>Engineering Sign Structures: An Introduction to Analysis and Design</h2><p>This comprehensive text more than meets the demand within the sign industry for a book on the structural engineering of signs.

Scott Fitzgerald</h2><p><p>Pigeonholed in popular memory as a Jazz Age epicurean, a playboy, and an emblem of the Lost Generation, F. Scott Fitzgerald was at heart a moralist struck by the nation&#x2019;s shifting mood and manners after World War I. In <i>Paradise Lost</i>, David Brown contends that Fitzgerald&#x2019;s deepest allegiances were to a fading antebellum world he associated with his father&#x2019;s Chesapeake Bay roots. Yet as a midwesterner, an Irish Catholic, and a perpetually in-debt author, he felt like an outsider in the haute bourgeoisie haunts of Lake Forest, Princeton, and Hollywood&#x2015;places that left an indelible mark on his worldview.</p><p>In this comprehensive biography, Brown reexamines Fitzgerald&#x2019;s childhood, first loves, and difficult marriage to Zelda Sayre. He looks at Fitzgerald&#x2019;s friendship with Hemingway, the golden years that culminated with <i>Gatsby</i>, and his increasing alcohol abuse and declining fortunes which coincided with Zelda&#x2019;s institutionalization and the nation&#x2019;s economic collapse.</p><p>Placing Fitzgerald in the company of Progressive intellectuals such as Charles Beard, Randolph Bourne, and Thorstein Veblen, Brown reveals Fitzgerald as a writer with an encompassing historical imagination not suggested by his reputation as &#x201c;the chronicler of the Jazz Age.&#x201d; His best novels, stories, and essays take the measure of both the immediate moment and the more distant rhythms of capital accumulation, immigration, and sexual politics that were moving America further away from its Protestant agrarian moorings. Fitzgerald wrote powerfully about change in America, Brown shows, because he saw it as the dominant theme in his own family history and life.</p></p><p>David S. Brown is the Raffensperger Professor of History at Elizabethtown College.&#x201c;Brown&#x2019;s book is a useful corrective to the figure of F. Scott Fitzgerald as a hopeless drunk and unrestrained reveler&#x2015;diving into the fountain at the Plaza and all that&#x2015;which has been vastly overdone...One of the splendid services rendered by Brown is to have convincingly made the case that F. Scott Fitzgerald was an original in a way much grander than he himself realized.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joseph Epstein</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] excellent book... <i>Paradise Lost</i>...conjures up an entirely different portrait from the one painted by previous biographers...

Brown has done much to add to the now-prodigious legacy of a man who, like Jay Gatsby, died alone despite having done so much for so many.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Rovie</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Brown produces the most clearly written biography of his subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Gottfried</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Conservative</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes when a historian turns to a literary figure the results are refreshing.

Arnheim&#x2019;s method, provocative in this age of technological wizardry, was to focus on the way art in film was derived from that medium&#x2019;s early limitations: no sound, no color, no three-dimensional depth.</p><p>"More than half a century since its initial publication, this deceptively compact book remains among the most incisive analyses of the formal and perceptual dynamics of cinema. No one who cares about film can afford to remain ignorant of its insights and wisdom. As digital technology fundamentally alters motion pictures, the lessons of Film as Art commend themselves as excellent insurance against reinventing the wheel in the new media landscape and hailing it as progress."--Edward Dimendberg author of "Film Noir and the Spaces of Modernity<br>"After more than eight decades, Rudolph Arnheim's small book of film theory remains one of the essential works in defining film art, understanding film less as reproducing the world than as opening up new possibilities for formal play and unexpected imagery. Anyone serious about film, whether scholar, filmmaker or simply a lover of cinema, must take Arnheim seriously."--Tom Gunning, author of "The Films of Fritz Lang (2000) and "D.W. Griffith and the Origins of American Narrative Film (1994)<br>"An aesthetic theory based on the formal 'limitations' of the medium, Arnheim's "Film as Art always provokes students in an age of few limits and less formality, and they argue and engage this classic text with unparalleled passion. Written in the wake of sound's transformation of the cinema, Arnheim's essays are not only central to understanding a major historical moment in theoretical debates about what constitutes the 'essence' of film, but also are a must read for anyone seeking a lucid, detailed, and rigorous argument about how works of art emerge from expressive constraint as much as expressive freedom."--Vivian Sobchack, author of "Carnal Thoughts(California, 2004) and many other books of film criticism.<b>Rudolf Arnheim</b> is Professor Emeritus of the Psychology of Art at Harvard University.

Out of print for almost thirty years&#x2014;due largely to initial audiences&#x2019; rejection of its strong black female protagonist&#x2014;Hurston&#x2019;s classic has since its 1978 reissue become perhaps the most widely read and highly acclaimed novel in the canon of African-American literature.</p></p><p>At the height of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston was the preeminent black woman writer in the United States. She was a sometime-collaborator with Langston Hughes and a fierce rival of Richard Wright. Her stories appeared in major magazines, she consulted on Hollywood screenplays, and she penned four novels, an autobiography, countless essays, and two books on black mythology. Yet by the late 1950s, Hurston was living in obscurity, working as a maid in a Florida hotel. She died in 1960 in a Welfare home, was buried in an unmarked grave, and quickly faded from literary consciousness until 1975 when Alice Walker almost single-handedly revived interest in her work. <p> Of Hurston's fiction, <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> is arguably the best-known and perhaps the most controversial. The novel follows the fortunes of Janie Crawford, a woman living in the black town of Eaton, Florida. Hurston sets up her characters and her locale in the first chapter, which, along with the last, acts as a framing device for the story of Janie's life. Unlike Wright and Ralph Ellison, Hurston does not write explicitly about black people in the context of a white world--a fact that earned her scathing criticism from the social realists--but she doesn't ignore the impact of black-white relations either: </p><blockquote> It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. </blockquote> One person the citizens of Eaton are inclined to judge is Janie Crawford, who has married three men and been tried for the murder of one of them. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but she <i>does</i> explain herself to her friend, Phoeby, with the implicit understanding that Phoeby can "tell 'em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me 'cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf." <p> Hurston's use of dialect enraged other African American writers such as Wright, who accused her of pandering to white readers by giving them the black stereotypes they expected. Decades later, however, outrage has been replaced by admiration for her depictions of black life, and especially the lives of black women. In <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> Zora Neale Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and women, and allows them to speak in their own voices. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, an American classic, is the luminous and haunting novel about Janie Crawford, a Southern Black woman in the 1930s, whose journey from a free-spirited girl to a woman of independence and substance has inspired writers and readers for close to 70 years.</p><p>This poetic, graceful love story, rooted in Black folk traditions and steeped in mythic realism, celebrates boldly and brilliantly African-American culture and heritage. And in a powerful, mesmerizing narrative, it pays quiet tribute to a Black woman who, though constricted by the times, still demanded to be heard.</p><p>Originally published in 1937 and long out of print, the book was reissued in 1975 and nearly three decades later <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> is considered a seminal novel in American fiction.</p><p>Performed by Ruby Dee</p></p><h2>Canning &amp; Preserving For Dummies, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>Everything you need to know to can and preserve your own food</p> <p>With the cost of living continuing to rise, more and more people are saving money and eating healthier by canning and preserving food at home.

He loved Roman republicanism, but saw himself as too principled for the mere politics that might have saved it. His life and lessons are urgently relevant in the harshly divided America&#x2015;and world&#x2015;of today. With erudition and verve, Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni turn their life of Cato into the most modern of biographies, <b>a blend of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and Game Change</b>."&#x2015;Howard Fineman, Editorial Director of The Huffington Post Media Group, NBC and MSNBC News Analyst, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Thirteen American Arguments</i> </p><p>"<b>A truly outstanding piece of work.</b> What most impresses me is the book's ability to reach through the confusing dynastic politics of the late Roman Republic to present social realities in a way intelligible to the modern reader. <i>Rome's Last Citizen</i> entertainingly restores to life the stoic Roman who inspired George Washington, Patrick Henry and Nathan Hale. This is more than a biography: it is a study of how a reputation lasted through the centuries from the end of one republic to the start of another."&#x2015;David Frum, <i>DailyBeast</i> columnist, former White House speech writer, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Right Man</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Marcus Porcius Cato: aristocrat who walked barefoot and slept on the ground with his troops, political heavyweight who cultivated the image of a Stoic philosopher, a hardnosed defender of tradition who presented himself as a man out of the sacred Roman past&#x2015;and the last man standing when Rome's Republic fell to tyranny. His blood feud with Caesar began in the chamber of the Senate, played out on the battlefields of a world war, and ended when he took his own life rather than live under a dictator.</p><p>Centuries of thinkers, writers, and artists have drawn inspiration from Cato's Stoic courage. Saint Augustine and the early Christians were moved and challenged by his example. Dante, in his <i>Divine Comedy</i><i>,</i> chose Cato to preside over the souls who arrive in Purgatory. George Washington so revered him that he staged a play on Cato's life to revive the spirit of his troops at Valley Forge. Now, in <i>Rome's Last Citizen</i><i>,</i> Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni deliver the first modern biography of this stirring figure.</p><p>Cato's life is a gripping tale that resonates deeply with our own turbulent times. He grappled with terrorists, a debt crisis, endemic political corruption, and a huge gulf between the elites and those they governed. In many ways, Cato was the ultimate man of principle&#x2015;he even chose suicide rather than be used by Caesar as a political pawn. But Cato was also a political failure: his stubbornness sealed his and Rome's defeat, and his lonely end casts a shadow on the recurring hope that a singular leader can transcend the dirty business of politics.</p><p><i>Rome's Last Citizen</i> is a timeless story of an uncompromising man in a time of crisis and his lifelong battle to save the Republic.</p></p><p>ROB GOODMAN has worked as the speechwriter for House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senator Chris Dodd.

The man dangling and shaking him out over the ground, intermittently threatening to drop him, is a stranger. He is Pompaedius Silo, an Italian politician visiting from out of town, a friend of Cato&#x2019;s uncle and guardian. He is in Rome to plead once more for citizenship for the towns of Italy, Rome&#x2019;s &#x201c;allies.&#x201d;<br>Pompaedius was evidently the kind of single-minded reformer who couldn&#x2019;t let the cause go even when playing with children. He&#x2019;d asked the boys of the house, with a smile, &#x201c;Come, beg your uncle to help us in our struggle.&#x201d; Though they barely understood the request, all of them, even Cato&#x2019;s half brother, had nodded yes. Cato had only stared.<br>There came another request for help, then a joke, then the guest&#x2019;s dropped smile, then threats, and still the angry stare from this four-year-old boy either dumb or self-possessed beyond his years, until he was shaken and dangled out the window&#x2014;without a scream, without a cry for help, yielding just that same unblinking stare.<br>After Pompaedius gave up and set the boy back on his feet, he was overheard to say, &#x201c;How lucky for Italy that he is a boy; if he were a man, I don&#x2019;t think we could get a single vote.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>It is the kind of perfect story that could only come from a culture that didn&#x2019;t believe in childhood. The truth is that we know precious little about the boy Cato, or the boy Caesar, or the boy Cicero. Most of the details of their childhoods, or any Roman childhood, were considered too trivial to remember. And when their stories do come down to us&#x2014;like the story of Cato and the window, told by Plutarch about a hundred years after the fact&#x2014;they are the stories of little adults. We talk about &#x201c;formative&#x201d; years, but in childhood stories like this one, it is as if the Romans were born fully formed.<br>Whether or not there was an authentic incident of a houseguest, a political controversy, and a children&#x2019;s game turned violent, this is, at the very least, a projection back into boyhood of all the indelible qualities of the grown Cato: stubbornness (or obstinacy); fearlessness (or foolhardiness); traditionalist politics (or reactionary politics). The story shows Cato grabbed by an overwhelming force, facing death, and evincing utter calm in the face of it. It shows him proving so unshakable that the force, while remaining every bit as overwhelming, recognizes that it has suffered some kind of moral defeat. Plutarch was a deliberate artist: He started Cato&#x2019;s life with a typology of his death.<br>What else do we know of Cato&#x2019;s beginnings? We know he was born in 95 to his mother Livia Drusa and father Marcus Cato, a senator of whom little record survives. The conventions of Roman childhood and parenting are well understood in outline, though we know little unique to Cato. If the first moments of his life were at all typical, the screaming newborn Cato was placed at the feet of his father. His father raised him from the ground, held him close, inspected him for signs of strength and health&#x2014;a tender gesture, but one that held the power of life and death. His father&#x2019;s nod made him a citizen and a son; rejected on the ground, he would have been marked a bastard and left to die. Several days&#x2019; wait, and he was given the name of his family&#x2019;s men for at least six generations: Marcus. Then came a series of rituals. The house was swept to rid it of evil spirits. A lucky golden locket was placed around the newborn&#x2019;s neck. His future was divined in the flight of birds and the entrails of sacrificed animals. All this signaled Cato&#x2019;s entrance into his father&#x2019;s household and family line.<br>Above all, of course, we know that Cato survived his earliest days&#x2014;no small feat in a culture that tested the toughness of newborns by exposing them to the elements, bathing them in ice water, and kneading the weakness out of their soft muscles. That there was not much weakness in Cato can be inferred from the simple fact that he lived.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Whether or not an enraged houseguest nearly defenestrated the boy Cato, what is indisputably true is the grievance the guest came to Rome to press. Italy hadn&#x2019;t always paid tribute to Rome: Its independence had been worn down over centuries of war. Even where Rome&#x2019;s authority was acknowledged, it was hardly welcomed. When Hannibal had marched over the Alps in 218, intent on conquering Rome, half of Italy had sided with him; when he was driven out, Rome punished the traitor cities severely, destroying some outright.<br>And yet, as Rome built an overseas empire, Italian soldiers shared the burden, manning up to two-thirds of the Roman army; Italian sons died alongside Romans to secure Sicily and Carthage and Greece. Romans and Italians were interchangeable to the conquered, indistinguishable <i>Romaioi</i>. Yet the spoils went overwhelmingly to the Roman capital, and Italians were denied the vote, even as they paid men and money into the Roman machine.<br>The Italian question had vexed Roman politics for generations, and it was a central theme in the brief careers of Rome&#x2019;s greatest radicals, the brothers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. Their failure is often considered the beginning of the Republic&#x2019;s slow end.<br>The oldest son of an old family, already decorated in war, Tiberius Gracchus is said to have conceived his political platform while on the march. A generation before Cato&#x2019;s birth, he was infuriated to see firsthand an Italian countryside almost entirely given over to imported slave gangs and the massive plantations of the Roman rich. He grieved that &#x201c;the Italian race&nbsp;... a people so valiant in war, and related in blood to the Romans, were declining little by little into pauperism and paucity of numbers without any hope of remedy.&#x201d; He also feared that Rome, with its hardy, small farmers on the decline, would grow increasingly vulnerable to its enemies.<br>In 133, soon after his return to Rome, Tiberius won election as tribune of the people. The Senate had set aside the office of the tribune as a pacifier for Rome&#x2019;s underclass, but it was rarely used for any radical purpose until Tiberius got his hands on it. He electrified Rome with his passionate words on behalf of the soldiers who fought to build an empire, even as their own small pieces of that empire were stripped away:<br>It is with lying lips that their commanders exhort the soldiers in their battles to defend sepulchres and shrines from the enemy; for not a man of them has an hereditary altar, not one of all these many Romans an ancestral tomb, but they fight and die to support others in wealth and luxury, and though they are styled masters of the world, they have not a single clod of earth that is their own.<br>On the strength of this rallying cry, Tiberius proposed to remedy Rome&#x2019;s wealth gap by capping the holdings of the rich and distributing public lands to the urban poor. Ignoring the outrage of Rome&#x2019;s senatorial establishment, Tiberius took his bill for land redistribution directly to the people&#x2019;s assembly, a body with the authority to pass laws, but one that rarely dared to defy the aristocracy. The Roman masses passed the land reform by acclamation.<br>In the Senate, Tiberius&#x2019;s success was perceived not merely as the action of a radical, but as the ambition of a would-be king, an attempt to put a faction in permanent power with the backing of the poor. Not long after passage of the land bill, a senator and neighbor of the Gracchus family was brought forward to testify that Tiberius was hiding a crown in his home. The Senate&#x2019;s suspicions seemed all but confirmed when Tiberius broke with Roman tradition and announced his campaign for a second consecutive year in office. It was only because he wanted immunity from political prosecution, he insisted. It was the first step to declaring himself tribune-for-life, his enemies said.<br>It is not surprising that the fracas ended in the murder of Tiberius and the death of his followers. What is astonishing is that the party of senators who beat Tiberius to death in open daylight was led by Rome&#x2019;s high priest, who wore his toga pulled over his head, just as he dressed when sacrificing an animal. The assassination of Tiberius was dressed up as a religious rite, a sacrifice to the Republic&#x2019;s guardian gods.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Tiberius&#x2019;s younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, escaped the killings&#x2014;and for the rest of his short life, &#x201c;the grief he had suffered encouraged him to speak out fearlessly.&#x201d; Friends and enemies alike painted Gaius as a man on fire for revenge. Yet, elected tribune ten years after Tiberius, he brought more than anger and grief to the work of coalition building and legislating. He brought a discipline that outdid his brother&#x2019;s. While Tiberius reached out to the Roman poor alone, Gaius made inroads with Rome&#x2019;s merchant class, the <i>equites</i> (so called because they could afford to outfit themselves with a horse in times of war). And in the most critical departure from his brother&#x2019;s example, Gaius invited Italians into his populist coalition. For the first time, a leading Roman was offering equal citizenship, including full voting rights, to Rome&#x2019;s closest Italian allies.<br>It was Gaius&#x2019;s most creative act of statesmanship&#x2014;but it was also the opening that allowed his conservative opponents a chance to destroy him. It took little effort to drive a wedge between Gaius&#x2019;s Italian and Roman backers: His opponents had only to point out that more voting power and more cheap bread for Italians meant less of both for Romans. &#x201c;If you give citizenship to the Latins,&#x201d; said one nativist...</p><h2>The Legal Environment of Business: A Managerial and Regulatory Perspective</h2><p>The Legal Environment of Business: A Managerial and Regulatory Perspective provides students with an accessible approach to the study of the legal and regulatory environment facing managers in the twenty-first century.

As a result, students and their parents are willing to go into years of debt and potentially sabotage their entire financial futures just to get a fancy name on their diploma. <br><br>But Zac Bissonnette is walking proof that this assumption is not only false, but dangerous-a class con game designed to rip you off and doom your student to a post-graduation life of near poverty . From his unique double perspective-he's a personal finance expert (at Daily Finance) AND a current senior at the University of Massachusetts-Zac figured out how to get an outstanding education at a public college, without bankrupting his parents or taking on massive loans. <br><br>Armed with his personal knowledge, the latest data, and smart analysis, Zac takes on the sacred cows of the higher education establishment. He reveals why a lot of the conventional wisdom about choosing and financing college is not only wrong but hazardous to you and your child's financial future. You'll discover, for instance, that: <br><br>* Student loans are NOT a necessary evil. Ordinary middle class families can- and <i>must</i>-find ways to avoid them, even without scholarships. <br><br>* College "rankings" are useless-designed to sell magazines and generate hype. If you trust one of the major guides when picking a college, you face a potential financial disaster. <br><br>* The elite graduate programs accept lots of people with non-elite bachelors degrees. So do America's most selective employers. The name on a diploma ultimately won't help your child have a more successful career or earn more money. <br><br>Zac can prove every one of those bold assertions - and more. No matter what your current financial situation, he has a simple message for parents: "RELAX!

As no other writer can, Schwartz captures the speech, the generational conflicts, the mocking self-analysis of educated, ambitious, Depression-stymied young people at odds with their immigrant parents. This is the unique American dilemma Irving Howe described as &#x201c;that interesting point where intellectual children of immigrant Jews are finding their way into the larger world while casting uneasy, rueful glances over their backs.&#x201d; Afterwords by James Atlas and Irving Howe place the stories in their historical and cultural setting.</p><p><p><strong>Delmore Schwartz</strong> (1913-1966) was born and raised in Brooklyn. One of America&#x2019;s greatest poets and short-story writers, Schwartz contributed &#x201c;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities&#x201d; to the first issue of <em>Partisan Review</em> in 1937. Schwartz taught at Syracuse, Princeton, and Kenyon College, and received the Bollingen Prize in 1959.

Edward Damer received his Ph.D. from Boston University and currently teaches at Emory and Henry College.</p><h2>Death in Ancient Rome</h2><p>For the Romans, the manner of a person&#x2019;s death was the most telling indication of their true character. Death revealed the true patriot, the genuine philosopher, even, perhaps, the great artist&#x2015;and certainly the faithful Christian. Catharine Edwards draws on the many and richly varied accounts of death in the writings of Roman historians, poets, and philosophers, including Cicero, Lucretius, Virgil, Seneca, Petronius, Tacitus, Tertullian, and Augustine, to investigate the complex significance of dying in the Roman world.<br>Death in the Roman world was largely understood and often literally viewed as a spectacle. Those deaths that figured in recorded history were almost invariably violent&#x2015;murders, executions, suicides&#x2015;and yet the most admired figures met their ends with exemplary calm, their last words set down for posterity. From noble deaths in civil war, mortal combat between gladiators, political execution and suicide, to the deathly dinner of Domitian, the harrowing deaths of women such as the mythical Lucretia and Nero&#x2019;s mother Agrippina, as well as instances of Christian martyrdom, Edwards engagingly explores the culture of death in Roman literature and history.</p><p><b>Catharine&nbsp;Edwards</b> is professor of classics and ancient&nbsp; history at Birkbeck College, University of London.

The people of the mountainous regions of what is now Iga prefecture wanted to live in peace, but their lords had other plans-so the people learned the martial arts of self-defense and used their meager farm tools as weapons against the samurai blades of their oppressors. Nine traditions of the ninja arts grew out of this seemingly endless struggle, and legends were told of the supernatural abilities of the ninja fighters. The ninja never gained the kind of power that topples tyrants, but they gained a reputation that made tyrants cautious. And they gained the kind of power that makes the spirit endure and the mind the master of its fate. Told in actual stories of past grandmasters and in dojo lectures on techniques-with photographs, drawings, and paintings-the last surviving grandmaster of the ancient art of ninjutsu, Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi, presents <i>Essence of Ninjutsu: The Nine Traditions</i>. In it, he explains why, after more than 900 years, the art of the shadow warriors continues to inspire and serve practitioners from around the world. Dr. Hatsumi's book contains historic ninja scrolls and describes techniques for self-defense, and it debunks tricks that are attributed to the ninja but actually derive more from the circus than the martial arts. <i>Essence of Ninjutsu</i> is a fascinating, authoritative look at the roots of ninjutsu and how it continues to enrich the lives of its practitioners today. Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi is a bone doctor, artist, and writer, as well as the 34th grandmaster of the nine schools of the ninja arts in Japan. He has toured the United States in recent years to help Americans better understand the ninja and their way of life. His articles have appeared in all of the major martial arts magazines.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Patterns for College Writing, High School Edition: A Rhetorical Reader and Guide</h2><p><p>Geared toward high school students, <em>Patterns for College Writing, High School Edition</em> focuses on the kinds of reading and writing you need to do in order to succeed in class and on state and national exams.</p></p><p>During their long collaboration, Laurie Kirszner and Stephen Mandell have written a number of best-selling college texts for Bedford/St. Martin&#39;s, including &#34;Patterns for College Writing, Foundations First, Writing First, Focus on Writing, &#34; and, most recently, &#34;Practical Argument.&#34; Laurie Kirszner is a Professor of English, Emeritus at the University of the Sciences, where she has taught composition, literature, creative writing, and scientific writing, and served as coordinator of the first-year writing program.

Baboons live in groups of up to 150, including a handful of males and eight or nine matrilineal families of females. Such numbers force baboons to form a complicated mix of short-term bonds for mating and longer-term friendships based on careful calculations of status and individual need.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But <i>Baboon Metaphysics</i> is concerned with much more than just baboons&#x2019; social organization&#x2014;Cheney and Seyfarth aim to fully comprehend the intelligence that underlies it. Using innovative field experiments, the authors learn that for baboons, just as for humans, family and friends hold the key to mitigating the ill effects of grief, stress, and anxiety.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written with a scientist&#x2019;s precision and a nature-lover&#x2019;s eye, <i>Baboon Metaphysics</i> gives us an unprecedented and compelling glimpse into the mind of another species. <br>&nbsp;&#x201c;The vivid narrative is like a bush detective story.&#x201d;&#x2014;Steven Poole, <i>Guardian</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>Baboon Metaphysics </i>is a distillation of a big chunk of academic lives. . . .

Ghazanfar, <i>Nature</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Through ingenious playback experiments . . . Cheney and Seyfarth have worked out many aspects of what baboons used their minds for, along with their limitations. Reading a baboon&#x2019;s mind affords an excellent grasp of the dynamics of baboon society. But more than that, it bears on the evolution of the human mind and the nature of human existence.&#x201d;&#x2014;Nicholas Wade, <i>New York</i><i> Times</i></p><p><b>Dorothy L. Cheney</b> is professor of biology and <b>Robert M. Seyfarth</b> is professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. They are the authors of <i>How Monkeys See the World</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press."Lovers' quarrels and murder, greed and social climbing: baboon society has all the features that make a mainstream novel a page-turner. The question Cheney and Seyfarth ask, however, is more demanding: how much of baboon behavior is instinctive, and how much comes from actual thought? Are baboons self-aware? To find answers, the authors spent years observing a clan of baboons in Botswana's Moremi Game Reserve. Like most primates, baboons are social creatures, living in large groups of 100, where individual rank&#x2014;and the ability to claim food or a mate&#x2014;is based on a complex web of birth and consort relationships. Cheney and Seyfarth pepper their descriptions with surprisingly apt literary comparisons, such as the example of a baboon who runs afoul of a higher-ranking member and receives much the same treatment as an unwitting character in an Edith Wharton novel. Along the way we get a good look at the state of current primate research on intelligence and learn why scientists think the human brain is still unique. While describing important research about baboon cognition and social relations, this book charms as much as it informs." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"As large, dog-snouted animals with ferocious teeth, baboons seem quite distant from us, yet they are genetically quite close to humans. There was even a time when these primates were seen as the best ancestral model for humans. Indeed, using a field technique perfected over the years with vervet monkeys and later with baboons, Cheney and Seyfarth reveal them to be accomplished social schemers. . . . As this lively book illustrates, these monkeys may show limitations in what they understand or care about, but they are absolutely unsurpassed at knowing every little detail of the relationship network of which they are a part.&#x201d;--Frans de Waal, <i>New Scientist</i> (Frans de Waal <i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>"The vivid narrative is like a bush detective story. . . and the authors' conclusions have intriguing implications for the evolution of language in humans." (Steven Poole <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>"Cheney and Seyfarth found that for a baboon to get on in life involves a complicated blend of short-term relationships, friendships, and careful status calculations; all of which must be weighed up against each baboon's personal needs and requirements. Needless to say, the ensuing political machinations and convenient romantic dalliances in the quest to become <i>numero uno</i> rival the bard himself.<i>&nbsp;Baboon Metaphysics</i> is a fascinating window on a world seemingly parallel to our own, while examining why science still considers the human brain unique."

Seyfarth and Dorothy L. Cheney&#x2014;pioneers in the study of primate psychology&#x2014;take up the challenge. . . . Any way you look at it, the authors say, most of the problems facing baboons can be expressed in two words: other baboons. The authors aim to understand the intelligence that underlies this social organization.&#x201d; (<i>Scientific American</i>)<br><br>Pursuing the understanding and existence of knowledge (metaphysics) in the best tradition of Darwinian naturalists with a philosophical interest, Cheney and Seyfarth probe the depth of baboon and other caterrhine primate social behavior that is the central context of the evolution of minds of social primates, including humans. In this engaging, thoughtful work, the authors range widely and plumb topics deeply. . . . Their dedication to field observations of baboons and other primates for decades, coupled with field experiments, renders this work unique. The book is a sagacious milestone that deserves the close attention not only of biologists and primatologists, but also of psychologists and social scientists. (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Accessible enough for most general readers, 'Baboon Metaphysics' does not assume prior knowledge of baboons, biology, or philosophy. Anyone dedicated enough can pick it up and digest its fascinating contents . . . [and] anyone seeking appreciation of the complexities of both animal and human life will find it here." (T.B. Robbins <i>Reviewer's Bookwatch</i>)<br><br>"Cheney and Seyfarth have produced a book that should be on the reading list of every scientist, student, and lay reader who searches for a seasoned, documented, and highly interesting thesis of what they have learned during decades of well-planned and executed research about the mind, thought, and intelligence of baboons." (<i>International Journal of Primatology</i>)<br><br><p>"This is an impressive story not just because of the care that went into the observations and experiments they record, but also in the philosophical implication of their thinking about the mental life of baboons. . . . Cheney and Seyfarth have set out to observe--and by a set of ingenious experiments, test--the mental processes of baboons as exhibited by their grasp of social complexity. . . . One thing is clear: whereas human self-importance once placed human beings outside nature, everything that has followed from research of the kind done by Jane Goodall and Cheney and Seyfarth makes it impossible to think in such terms any longer."</p> (A.

But how? Travel back in time to December 28, 1848 in London, England to one of the most famous juvenile science Christmas lectures at the Royal Institution. British scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) encouraged kids to carefully observe a candle and to try to figure out how it burned.&nbsp;<br>Known as one of the best science experimenters ever, Faraday's passion was always to answer the basic questions of science: "What is the cause? Why does it occur?"<br>Since Faraday's lecture, "<i>The Chemical History of a Candle</i>," was published in 1861, it's never been out of print. Oddly, till now, it's never been published as a children's picture book. Faraday originally gave seven lectures on how a candle burns. Pattison has adapted the first 6000-word lecture to about 650 words for modern elementary students.&nbsp;</p><p><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&nbsp;</b><b>Darcy Pattison</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Abayomi, the Brazilian Puma: The True Story of an Orphaned Cub</i>, which was named a 2015 National Science Teacher's Association Outstanding Science Trade Book.&nbsp;<i>Desert Baths</i>&nbsp;was named a 2013 NSTA Outstanding Science Trade Book.

His illustrations have palpable character, bringing them to life through his craft and quirky approach. He lives in North East England with his wife and daughter. This is his debut picture book. Peter Willis brings humor to the story, but he also manages to convey accurate information about matter and its physical properties.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Adapted from scientist Michael Faraday's own "Chemical History of a Candle," this is the story of one of the Royal Institution's Christmas lectures for children, specifically, Faraday's 1848 talk and demonstration on candles. The lecture series began in 1825 and has continued to present day, with a pause during World War II. The story starts with descriptions of the excitement of the crowd, the sights and sounds of the London streets, and the lecture hall, structured for the crowd's ease of observation and safety. Faraday guides the crowd, describing what is happening and the thought process a scientist uses when making observations. A diagram aids in the discussion of what happens when a candle burns. The main takeaway is that readers should always ask and answer the questions "What is the cause? Why does it occur?" when making observations. The book is whimsically illustrated in various media and incorporates printed text into the artwork. However, the text, which includes challenging vocabulary, British spellings, and, occasionally, odd sentence structures left over from the adaptation of the original lecture, makes the intended audience unclear. VERDICT Despite a few missteps, this is a potential selection for readers who will have the opportunity to perform experiments afterward or those beginning to learn the process of scientific inquiry.

Mulholland, a self-taught engineer, was the chief architect of the Owens Valley Aqueduct&#x2014;a project ranking in magnitude and daring with the Panama Canal&#x2014;that brought water to semi-arid Los Angeles from the lush Owens Valley. The story of Los Angeles's quest for water is both famous and notorious: it has been the subject of the classic yet historically distorted movie <i>Chinatown,</i> as well as many other accounts. This first full-length biography of Mulholland challenges many of the prevailing versions of his life story and sheds new light on the history of Los Angeles and its relationship with its most prized resource: water.<br><br>Catherine Mulholland, the engineer's granddaughter, provides insights into this story that family familiarity affords, and adds to our historical understanding with extensive primary research in sources such as Mulholland's recently uncovered office files, newspapers, and Department of Water and Power archives. She scrutinizes Mulholland's life&#x2014;from his childhood in Ireland to his triumphant completion of the Owens Valley Aqueduct to the tragedy that ended his career. This vivid portrait of a rich chapter in the history of Los Angeles is enhanced with a generous selection of previously unpublished photographs.<br><br><i>Los Angeles Times Best Nonfiction Book of 2000</i></p><p>"William Mulholland was a famed and infamous water and civil engineer, best known for two extraordinary moments in the environmental history of California, one a colossal success, the other an equally stunning failure. The first is the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the second is the building of the fated St. Francis Dam, which came crashing down in 1928. Catherine Mulholland deals with her grandfather's alpha and omega moments dispassionately and in detail. But in between those events are more than a decade in the life of the great engineer and potential politician, and we gain a rich profile of the entire era here.

Nuland tells the strange story of Ign�c Semmelweis with urgency and the insight gained from his own studies and clinical experience. Ign�c Semmelweis is remembered for the now-commonplace notion that doctors must wash their hands before examining patients. In mid-nineteenth-century Vienna, however, this was a subversive idea. With deaths from childbed fever exploding, Semmelweis discovered that doctors themselves were spreading the disease. While his simple reforms worked immediately&#x2015;childbed fever in Vienna all but disappeared&#x2015;they brought down upon Semmelweis the wrath of the establishment, and led to his tragic end.</p></p><p>Sherwin B. Nuland (1930&#x2015;2014) was the National Book Award-winning author of How We Die and clinical professor of surgery at the Yale University School of Medicine.Many people have heard of Semmelweis, whose fame rests on having shown in the 1840s that deaths from puerperal fever (an infection following childbirth) at the Vienna Lying-in Hospital could be reduced by making doctors and medical students wash their hands in a disinfectant solution before entering the maternity ward. His observations were largely ignored during his lifetime and for many years after his death in 1865. Near the end of the 19th century, however, and especially after the publication of a hagiographic biography in 1909, Semmelweis's reputation was raised to the skies. I know of no one else in the history of medicine whose reputation rose from the extreme of oblivion to reverence as one of medicine's greatest heroes. After he had acquired heroic status, it was asserted that Semmelweis was the first to discover that puerperal fever was contagious, that his work had led to the abolition of puerperal fever, that his now famous treatise, The Etiology, the Concept, and the Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever (1861) (Figure), was one of the greatest medical works of the 19th century, and that lack of support by his colleagues in Vienna drove Semmelweis mad. Since the 1970s, however, a small band of Semmelweis scholars have shown that few of these assertions are correct and that the truth about Semmelweis is much more complex -- and certainly more interesting -- than the conventional picture. That Semmelweis made some brilliant observations in 1847 on the manner in which puerperal fever is transmitted is beyond doubt. But he was his own worst enemy. His dogmatism, arrogance, hostility, and unforgivable rudeness to colleagues who dared to question his views, combined with his failure to publish his findings for 14 years, damaged his reputation. Such revelations prompted Sherwin Nuland to publish a paper entitled "The Enigma of Semmelweis: An Interpretation" in 1979. This book is a welcome expansion of that paper, with important additional information. There is broad agreement within the small group of historians who have studied Semmelweis since the 1970s that he possessed a complex and difficult character and about how his reputation rose from oblivion to fame. There are still disputes about both the nature of the mental illness from which Semmelweis suffered in his last few years and the cause of his death. Nuland, who believes that Semmelweis died as a result of a brutal attack by the staff of the lunatic asylum to which he had been admitted a fortnight before his death, has produced new evidence that supports this theory. But Nuland's certainty that Semmelweis suffered from Alzheimer's disease is not shared by most historians. That he was mentally deranged, or insane, or mad (whichever term you prefer) in his last few years is beyond dispute; but retrospective diagnosis of a mental illness that occurred in the 19th century is so difficult that exactly what illness Semmelweis was affected by may never be known. Unfortunately, this book has no index, no footnotes or endnotes, and only a brief bibliographic note. There are many places where one longs to know the evidence for new data; and there is the problem of the first chapter, which presents a detailed account of a young girl who becomes pregnant, is admitted to the General Hospital of Vienna in 1847, and dies of puerperal fever. The chapter is fictional in style and contains colloquial speech. For instance, a medical student says to the girl, "Please pay attention, young miss!" and the girl says to a nurse, "Please don't tell me I could die having a baby. Oh, please, please, Nurse, I couldn't bear to think of it," to which the nurse replies, "Hush, hush. . . . You'll get yourself all worried and excited for no reason." Because no source is given, I can only assume that part or even the whole of the first chapter is historical fiction. If so, it is out of place in an otherwise admirable history of the life and work of Semmelweis. <i>Irvine Loudon, D.M., F.R.C.G.P.</i><br>Copyright � 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Vous dirais-je, maman,&#x201d; sang his three-year-old daughter with her clear, perfect voice from her perch on an upturned bucket, unaware of the sky or the bees or the tremor of fear that shook the breath from his lungs.</p><p>&#x201c;Colette, calme-toi,&#x201d; he said, putting his finger to his lips.</p><p>The little girl stopped singing and stared up at her father with a question in her dark eyes. He had never asked her to stop before.</p><p>Keeping his finger to his lips, Giles closed his eyes, listening. A low hum escaped from inside the hive, quieter now, a volume dial turned low on a radio. A sign to any beekeeper that something was wrong. The queen had died, perhaps. Or any of the dreaded parasites&#x2014;mites or beetles, even&#x2014;had invaded the hive, taking over an entire population and killing them.</p><p>Or the entire colony had become aware, even before Giles, that the one thing he&#x2019;d hoped and prayed would never happen was now waiting with open arms on his doorstep. And the bees had chosen a sudden death instead of a long, lingering passing.</p><p>He strained to listen, wanting to hear beyond the sound of the bees and the circling birds and his own breathing. There. There it was. The gurgle and thrum of multiple engines. Not cars. Trucks. Large trucks to transport as many people as possible, a slow convoy climbing its way through the small farms and vibrant fields of Provence.</p><p>It was inevitable, he supposed. As soon as the Germans had invaded the free zone in southern France the previous November, there was nobody to protect them. Not even a puppet government. His chest expanded and contracted as a cloud of dust and cut hay churned up by the trucks&#x2019; tires drifted over the winding dirt road in the far distance like poison descending on the valley.</p><p>He thought of the family now huddled in his barn, in the small room he&#x2019;d created beneath the hidden trapdoor covered with bales of hay. A mother and father and three small children, the woman&#x2019;s belly swollen with a fourth. He hadn&#x2019;t even asked their names. These families came and went so frequently that he&#x2019;d stopped asking. It was easier that way, later. When he&#x2019;d learn that some hadn&#x2019;t made it over the mountains to safety it was better that he hadn&#x2019;t known their names.</p><p>Giles cursed under his breath. Three days before, when the cobbler had sent his new assistant, he&#x2019;d known. He&#x2019;d seen the way the young man&#x2019;s eyes had darted about the barn, taking in the tidy table and bench pushed against the wall. The way the cobwebs had been swept out of the corners of the rafters. The neatly stacked tools, carefully placed. All signs of a woman&#x2019;s touch, yet Giles&#x2019;s wife had been dead for three years. Yes, Giles had known even then. And the bees had known, too.</p><p>Half an hour. That&#x2019;s all he had before the trucks reached his farm, saw the brightly painted beehives and the stone house where his family had lived for almost two hundred years in the shadow of the ch�teau. Before they reached the barn and started moving the hay. His nostrils flared as the exhaust fumes overtook the sweet scents of his beloved fields, and he turned abruptly to Colette.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;est le temps.&#x201d; He picked her up, her warm breath on his neck, and began to run.</p><p>She started to cry before they&#x2019;d even reached the barn, her sobs already hiccups by the time the family had crawled from their hiding place and begun their escape across the lavender fields, their shadows chasing them through the rows of purple.</p><p>In the kitchen at the back of the farmhouse he removed the small leather suitcase that had been Colette&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s, packed the same day he&#x2019;d decided he could no longer be a bystander. Carefully he took the teapot from the hutch, where it had been nestled between its matching cups and plates, the feel of the china fragile beneath his rough hands, as he remembered his dead wife and how she&#x2019;d loved beautiful things, how she&#x2019;d loved to set the table and eat from the delicate plates. The china set had been a wedding gift from the ch�teau to his grandparents, a thank-you for his family&#x2019;s years of service.</p><p>He wrapped it in a small towel and tucked it carefully amid Colette&#x2019;s clothing inside the case, then lifted the little girl into his arms again, pressing his forehead to hers. &#x201c;It will be all right, ma petite ch�rie. Madame Bosco has promised to look after you until I return.&#x201d; He lifted the suitcase and began walking swiftly from the house toward the neighboring farm. The Boscos were a large Italian-French family with seven children of their own and had not asked him why he might need to leave his daughter for an unspecified amount of time. It was better they did not know.</p><p>&#x201c;Non, Papa.&#x201d; Colette&#x2019;s bottom lip quivered, but he dared not slow or look behind him.</p><p>He pressed her blond head against his chest as he walked faster, seeing the lights of the stone farmhouse, white sheets flapping on the clothesline like a warning. The door opened before he reached it. Madame Bosco&#x2019;s large, round form filled the doorway, the light illuminating her. A young girl, dark haired like her mother but slender as a reed, peered out from behind madame.</p><p>&#x201c;Go back inside,&#x201d; the woman said to the girl. &#x201c;Keep your brothers and sisters away from the door.&#x201d; She waited until her daughter had left, the girl stealing a glance over her shoulder only once. Madame Bosco turned back to Giles. &#x201c;It is time?&#x201d; she asked, her voice low.</p><p>Giles nodded, holding Colette even tighter, knowing what a terrible thing he was asking the child to do. And how this very scene must be playing out again and again all over the burning fields of Europe. A chorus of children&#x2019;s cries and parents&#x2019; despair that fell on parched earth and thick air that smelled of burning things. The wailing might be heard, but no one was listening.</p><p>He touched his lips to Colette&#x2019;s sweat-soaked forehead and tearstained cheek, breathing in the scent of her one last time. &#x201c;You are my heart, ma ch�rie,&#x201d; he said, holding her small fist tightly in his own larger one, replaying something they did every night. &#x201c;And only you can set it free.&#x201d; He opened his hand and wiggled his fingers like petals on a sunflower. Even in her misery, the little girl remembered her part and opened her own hand, the small fingers slow and heavy.</p><p>&#x201c;Remember this,&#x201d; Giles whispered in her ear, the folds and curves as delicate as a flower. &#x201c;Remember you are my heart.&#x201d;</p><p>Before he could change his mind, he handed Colette to the welcoming arms of Madame Bosco. There were tears in her eyes as she held the sobbing child. &#x201c;We will keep her safe until you return. We have already instructed the children.&#x201d;</p><p>Giles nodded, remembering her mother, as he stroked Colette&#x2019;s blond curls. He slid a postcard from his pocket and handed it to madame, his thumb obscuring the foreign stamps. The edges were torn and frayed from having been held and read so many times, the image of the beach with impossibly white sand engraved on his memory. &#x201c;If something happens, let my friend know. His name and address are on here. If I can&#x2019;t find you, I will go to him.&#x201d; He paused for a moment. &#x201c;Keep it hidden. It will be safer for you that way. No questions.&#x201d;</p><p>Madame Bosco nodded and he felt the trembling in her hand as she took the postcard. &#x201c;I will pray that I will put this back in your hands along with Colette when this is all over.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her a solemn stare. &#x201c;I hope God listens to your prayers. He hasn&#x2019;t listened to mine in a very long time.&#x201d; Lifting the suitcase, he set it inside the kitchen door. &#x201c;Be careful with this. I have wrapped something precious inside, something of her home and family. Please keep them both safe.&#x201d;</p><p>One last time Giles pressed his lips against Colette&#x2019;s soft curls. &#x201c;Au revoir, ma ch�rie. I will come back for you; I promise. However long it takes.&#x201d;</p><p>The little girl looked up at him with her mother&#x2019;s eyes, large and dark. She reached for him. &#x201c;Ne va pas, Papa! Don&#x2019;t leave me!&#x201d; She struggled to release herself from the woman&#x2019;s grasp, her legs kicking frantically.</p><p>&#x201c;Be safe,&#x201d; madame said, her own eyes damp. &#x201c;Until we meet again.&#x201d;</p><p>He touched her arm and pressed it, grief like cement filling his throat. With one last glance back, he turned in the opposite direction from his farm and began to run. He heard his daughter sobbing as the sky cast out the light, and imagined he could hear the sound of dead bees hitting the parched earth, lamenting the passing of all that was good.</p><p></p><br><p>Chapter 1</p><p>&#x201c;The bee collects honey from flowers in such a way as to do the least damage or destruction to them, and he leaves them whole, undamaged and fresh, just as he found them.&#x201d;</p><p>St. Francis de Sales</p><p>&#x2014;Ned Bloodworth&#x2019;s Beekeeper&#x2019;s Journal</p><p>Georgia</p><p>April 2015</p><p>New Orleans</p><p>Memories are a thief. They slip up behind you when you least expect it, their cold hands pressed against your face, suffocating. They blow icy-cold air even on the hottest days, and pinch you awake in the middle of the night. My grandfather had once told me that memories were like a faucet you could turn on or off at will, and that after I got to be as old as he was, I&#x2019;d have figured out how it works. Maybe I just wasn&#x2019;t old enough, because my memories always had a way of getting stuck in the on position, flooding my mind with images and snatches of conversations I&#x2019;d rather not relive.</p><p>Perhaps that explained my obsession with old things, with antique clocks, armoires, and shoes. My fascination with ancient books filled with brittle paper, mismatched china pieces, and old-fashioned keys and their corresponding locks. It was as if these relics had been left for me to claim as my own, to make up a past that was devoid of my own memories.</p><p>Old china was my favorite. It allowed me to live vicariously through somebody else&#x2019;s imagined life, to participate in family meals and celebrations, to pretend to be a part of a bride&#x2019;s place-setting selection. Experiences from somebody else&#x2019;s life, but definitely not my own. Despite, or probably because of, my family&#x2019;s well-grounded belief that I was born to founder, I&#x2019;d discovered a vocation I not only loved but was actually good at. I was an expert in most things antique, a sought-after consultant, and proof that it&#x2019;s possible to become someone different from the person you&#x2019;d once been. The person everybody expected you to still be. If only I could have figured out how to turn off the memories, I might have been able to sink comfortably into the new life I&#x2019;d created from old china and discarded furniture.</p><p>I dipped a cotton swab into the cleaning solution and dabbed at the intricate scrollwork of the padlock on my desk. The silver shield-shaped lock with grained bar-and-diamond-embellished trim had been found in a box of old horse tackle in a barn in New Hampshire at an estate sale. Mr. Mandeville, my boss, and owner of the Big Easy Auction Gallery, had grudgingly let me go. I had a good eye and an even better instinct about these things, and after eight years of my working for Mr. Mandeville, he&#x2019;d finally started to agree. I would study the history of a property and its owner when an estate sale was announced so that I could look at pictures of boxes stacked in an old barn or pushed against the walls of a humid attic and know what treasures I&#x2019;d find.</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t say that I was particularly happy, or as successful as I&#x2019;d like to be, but there was nobody in my life to ask me whether I was. Nobody to hold up a mirror to make me see whom I had become, or to see the person I&#x2019;d been who had never really believed she could be anything more than ordinary. My mother had once told me that she didn&#x2019;t know that particular sorrow, the sorrow of being ordinary. But I did. And I relished it, if only because it made me not her.</p><p>I opened the large bottom drawer of my desk, listening to the clink and slide of dozens of mismatched keys and padlocks I&#x2019;d collected over the years, my hope of finding a matching key and lock one of the stupid little games I played with myself. I&#x2019;d just grabbed a fistful of keys when I heard the front door of the building open, the bell clanging ominously in the empty space. It was Sunday, the offices and gallery below were closed, and nobody was supposed to be there. Which was precisely why I was there, unconcerned about the vintage jeans with frayed bell-bottoms that sat a little too low on my hips, flip-flops, a 1960s tie-dyed T-shirt, and hair pulled back in a ponytail that made me look about ten years old.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia?&#x201d; Mr. Mandeville called up the stairs. The gallery was an old cotton warehouse on Tchoupitoulas, and every word bounced and ricocheted off the brick walls and wood floors unencumbered by rugs or wall coverings of any sort.</p><p>I stood to let him know where I was, then froze as I heard another male voice and two sets of footsteps climbing the stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia?&#x201d; he called again.</p><p>Knowing he&#x2019;d probably seen my car in the small parking lot behind the building, I sat down behind my desk, hoping to at least hide my flip-flops.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in my office,&#x201d; I shouted unnecessarily, their footsteps coming to a stop outside my door. &#x201c;Come in.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Mandeville opened the door and stepped through, then ushered his companion inside. The tall ceilings and windows dwarfed most people, including my boss, but not the visitor. He was very tall, maybe six feet, four inches, with thick and wavy strawberry-blond hair. As a person who studied objects of beauty for a living, I decided that&#x2019;s what he was and didn&#x2019;t bother to hide my scrutiny.</p><p>He was lean but broad shouldered, the bones in his face strong and well placed, his eyes the color of cobalt Wedgwood Jasperware. As they approached, I stood, forgetting what I must look like, and allowed my gaze to rove over the full length of him like I would a Victorian armoire or Hepplewhite chair. I&#x2019;d started to grin to myself as I realized I must be one of a very small number of women who&#x2019;d compare a handsome man to a piece of furniture.</p><p>He must have caught my grin, because the man stopped about five feet from me, a pensive look on his face. It took me a moment to realize that he was studying me with the same examination I&#x2019;d just given him.</p><p>I sat down quickly, chagrined to know that I wasn&#x2019;t as immune as I believed myself to be.</p><p>Mr. Mandeville frowned slightly at me seated behind my desk. I knew he had issues with my insistence on solitude and working long hours. He was a family man who thrived on noise and bustle and the adoration of his employees and extended family. But he&#x2019;d never had concern over my manners. Until now, apparently.</p><p>&#x201c;Georgia Cha...</p></p><h2>Venice Reconsidered: The History and Civilization of an Italian City-State, 1297&#x2013;1797</h2><p><p><i>Venice Reconsidered</i> offers a dynamic portrait of Venice from the establishment of the Republic at the end of the thirteenth century to its fall to Napoleon in 1797. In contrast to earlier efforts to categorize Venice's politics as strictly republican and its society as rigidly tripartite and hierarchical, the scholars in this volume present a more fluid and complex interpretation of Venetian culture.

It provides assessment strategies: to identify the function of behavior and specific strategies within each function; to increase appropriate behavior and those to support and partner with families; for providing consultation and working as a team to address behavior. This approach to functional assessment and intervention introduces a sensory regulation/sensory stimulation function and provides strategies related to sensory-based challenging behavior. Its strong use of vignettes and open-ended case studies promotes problem-solving among readers as they identify the function of behavior, choose intervention options, and pinpoint typical functional assessment practices. Taking a comprehensive and positive approach to managing behavior, this practical book provides useful applications to assist education professionals and families in selecting detailed interventions to address challenging behavior. Through these positive interventions, appropriate behavior is supported, replacing challenging behavior. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Written for special and general educators, consultants, therapists, administrators, and families who work with students and children with behavior concerns, this comprehensive, practical treatment of the topic presents a functional assessment model based on a naturalistic and team-based approach in preventing and resolving challenging behavior in school settings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>New to this Edition!</b> </p> <ul> <li> <b>NEW!

We also have extensive experience conducting functional assessment in a variety of settings, across a variety of ages of students, and with students with and without disabilities. We wrote this book because we needed a practical and easily understood model of functional assessment that dealt specifically with school-aged populations and settings. When we conducted workshops and taught courses in functional assessment, students and participants often asked if there was something published that they could give to other educators, parents, or administrators or that they could read as they tried to apply functional assessment. This book is a result of their requests. This book turns theory and research into practical applications in school settings and situations. </p> <p> We present a comprehensive and positive approach to the prevention and remediation of challenging behavior using functional assessment. The book is written for special and regular educators and consultants who work in school settings. </p> <p> This book is divided into four sections that take the reader through the process of conducting functional assessment and implementing interventions based on the function of behavior: </p> <p> <br>* Part One (Chapters I to 3) provides an introduction to challenging behavior and functional assessment. It presents the rationale for addressing challenging behavior, common misconceptions about the causes of challenging behavior, and it provides a rationale for using functional assessment and describes the assumptions and goals of functional assessment. <br>* Part Two (Chapters 4 and 5) describes the process of conducting functional assessment in school settings and identifying the function of behavior. <br>* Part Three (Chapters 6 to 11) presents suggestions and tips for selecting and implementing function-based interventions. It also presents specific intervention strategies by behavior function: positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, and sensory regulation/sensory stimulation increase and decrease. Finally, it provides suggestions for implementing strategies to prevent the development of challenging behavior. <br>* Part Four (Chapters 12 and 13) provides guidelines for program implementation and consultation. It discusses common problems encountered in conducting functional assessment and in providing consultation to educators. It then provides strategies to prevent and remediate those problems. Part Four also includes problem-solving case studies. These case studies allow the reader to practice functional assessment and to develop intervention plans to address challenging behavior. <br> </p> <p> This book contains numerous examples of functional assessment as it is employed in school settings. Examples cover all ages of students (preschool through high school), both regular and self-contained special education settings as well as other school and home settings, a variety of challenging behaviors, and students with and without disabilities. The examples also include a variety of team members who conduct the assessment and implement intervention strategies. <br></p></p><h2>Son of a Grifter: The Twisted Tale of Sante and Kenny Kimes, the Most Notorious Con Artists in America: A Memoir by the Other Son</h2><p><p>In 1998 a troubled young man and his flamboyant mother were arrested for murdering a wealthy widow in her New York City mansion. Suddenly, America was transfixed by a pair of real-life film noir characters, an Oedipal team of scam artists who left a trail of blood, lies, and larceny from coast to coast. The media couldn't get enough of the twisted relationship between Sante Kimes and her twenty-three-year-old son Kenny.</p><p>But the most chilling story of all was never told -- until now. Kent Walker, Sante's elder son, reveals how he survived forty years of "the Dragon Lady's" very special brand of motherly love and still managed to get away.</p><p>As a child Kent watched his mother destroy his hardworking father, Ed Walker, and then -- with Kent's painful collusion -- snare what Sante called "my millionaire." When she married seemingly respectable real-estate developer Ken Kimes, it was a match made in hell.</p><p>For the next two decades Kent's mother and stepfather indulged in a globetrotting orgy of criminal behavior, laying waste to each other and anyone who got in the way. Kent, their would-be recruit, was privvy to the family business -- torching houses, defrauding friends, crashing White House parties, "shopping" for trunkloads of fur coats -- and Sante's self-serving style of adultery. When Kent's half-brother, Kenny was born, Kent was twelve years old -- old enough to know that he was his younger sibling's only protector. Kent tried desperately to save Kenny from his mother's sinister bidding. His failure haunts him to this day.</p><p>Here, with shocking and sometimes brutal frankness, Kent explodes the romantic Hollywood image of the grifter as antihero and exposes the truth about Sante Kimes behind the headlines. <em>Sone of a Grifter</em> poignantly chronicles what it means to love somebody despite your better instincts, your worst fears, and even your most forbidden hopes. </p></p><p><p>Kent Walker lives in California with his wife and children.</p>Convicted last year of murdering millionaire heiress Irene Silverman in New York City and waiting to stand trial for a second murder in California, Sante and Kenny Kimes, mother and son, have become two of the best-known American criminals of recent years. In the wake of widespread, high-profile media coverage, this book purports to fill in missing details of Sante's murky biography. Walker, who is Sante Kimes's eldest son and half-brother to Kenny, catalogues the wrongdoings of the woman he still affectionately calls "Mom," including everything from shoplifting and theft to multiple counts of arson, insurance fraud and slavery. Walker vividly recounts his childhood with Sante and her third husband, Ken Kimes, detailing how the couple indoctrinated him into criminality. The author, who appears to be exorcising personal demons, does a fine job of elucidating the psychological and emotional price of being loved and cared for by a sociopath. It is this tension, between the loving mother and the criminal willing to neglect and at times even betray her child, that pushes the story forward. Unfortunately, the litany of crimes is so vast and comes so fast that the narrative never quite lingers long enough to develop real drama or suspense. Well researched and touching, though, it testifies to how one son can evolve into a killer and the other live to tell the tale. As a chronicle of Sante Kimes's life, it's unlikely to be surpassed by any other. The only person likely to tell a more intimate tale is Sante herself. Photos not seen by PW. (April 23)Forecast: This is the first major look at the criminal Kimes family, and with the media attention surrounding the forthcoming trial as well as appearances by Walker on Larry King and NBC's Dateline it should attract many readers throughout the summer.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Study Guide for Gravetter/Wallnau&#x2019;s Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, 8th</h2><p>Study more effectively and improve your performance at exam time with this comprehensive guide.

Everything about them. Always have. <br><br> A restaurant is both a superficial and deeply profound experience. Restaurants can leave an existential mark on your life though you&#x2019;re essentially just sitting down in a place to eat food and drink booze. <br><br> A restaurant is built on a foundation of broken hearts, failed relationships, trips to the hardware store, the clinic, extended credit and the goodwill of people who care about you. Writing a book and building a restaurant are deeply personal acts. They require everything of you, your passion and your spirit. You can meander in fits and starts for months, years even, down the wrong path, all to get to the right one. Books and restaurants, the best ones in my estimation, are built on unworkable rewrites and failed ideas, and let me tell you: that body count is high.<br><br> Writing a book or opening a restaurant can make you lose your mind. <br><br> Until you haven&#x2019;t. <br><br> And then it clicks. And <i>that&#x2019;s </i>Day 1. <i>That&#x2019;s</i> where you start. <br><br> Building and then maintaining a restaurant is about loyalty. And this is why Joe Beef thrives. Because it is a deeply personal restaurant. That is not to say the food made in this tiny French restaurant isn&#x2019;t technically on point (it is) or that the old cottage influence of Maine or Gasp� won&#x2019;t fill you with nostalgia (it will), or that the care of the staff doesn&#x2019;t enchant you (they do).<br><br>The attraction to Joe Beef is due to its authenticity. You cannot bullshit people with an inauthentic voice or cooking.&nbsp; Well, you can. But it won&#x2019;t last.<br><br> &#x201c;Deeply personal&#x201d; is the beginning and the end of Fred and David&#x2019;s playbook.<br><br> ***<br><br> The point of a prologue is to make overarching sense of the chapters, to lay out the sequence of what you&#x2019;re about to read. To pop the hood and preview what&#x2019;s inside. But I&#x2019;m not going to do that. Because this book is simply about <i>where we are now. <br></i><br> Surviving the Apocalypse was a theme we dreamt up in 2014. We&#x2019;re well aware there have been a few instances (some extreme weather, more-than-extreme elections) over the last couple years when it seemed survivalism and talk of impending doom had jumped the shark. The cars were packed and the <i>E.T.&nbsp; </i>suits were zipped. The zeitgeist seemed to be closing in on us. Maybe the world was <i>actually</i> going to end. But this book was never about the headline.<br><br> <i>This book is about how to build things for yourself. <br></i><br> <i>This book is about how to make it on your own. <br></i><br> We don&#x2019;t expect anyone to build a trout pond that doesn&#x2019;t work, like our pond at Joe Beef. Or to create your own makeshift cellar to house 31 bunker-friendly foods (though it would be prudent). But maybe you&#x2019;ll write a poem about the Laurentians. Or make wine in a Yeti cooler. Or cook up a Pot-au-Feu in the autumn for your girlfriend, and then a baby for the spring. <br><br> We set out to write a book about shutting out the noise, because that was the problem in our own lives. We vowed there would be fewer recipes than in our first book (<i>The Art of Living According to Joe Beef </i>henceforth referred to as Book One), because recipes are time-consuming to write, but... we found inspiration in our weird theme and are giving you even more this time around (158!). So, the joke&#x2019;s on us.<br><br> After 12 years of Joe Beef, and seven years after our first book, we think you know us by now. And so, in the pages to come, you&#x2019;ll find good ideas, less good ideas and other ramblings. You&#x2019;ll find etiquette on how children should behave at dinner, quick tricks for cheat sauces, a chapter devoted to the weird and wonderful Qu�bec tradition of celebrating Christmas-in-July, a recipe for soap, and a towering cake made of rum balls.<br><br> I waitressed at Joe Beef on Day 1. We never thought we would make it to Week 2. <br><br> We never imagined people could love the restaurant as much as they do. <br><br> We never dreamt of writing a book.<br><br> We never thought anyone other than maybe our moms would buy the book.<br><br> And we definitely didn&#x2019;t think we would have the opportunity for a second.<br><br> With gratitude and tremendous love, this book is dedicated to our city of Montreal.<br><br>&#x2014;M.&nbsp;E.</p><h2>Feminists Theorize the Political</h2><p>First published in 1992.

Most appear here for the first time since their original publication in scholarly journals and art magazines, while some have never been published before. Representing 40 years of engagement with the arts, the essays cover a broad spectrum of topics, from Fry's influential promotion of Post-Impressionism to art education, museums, architecture, decorative art, and the implications of literature and dance for the visual arts. Reed also provides valuable historical background and considers Fry's legacy for the present. <i>A Roger Fry Reader</i> affords an opportunity to examine both the foundations of modern art criticism from the point of view of one of its foremost practitioners and current debates about the nature ofart and aesthetic experience.<br></p></p><p>It is good to have this selection of the writings of English critic Fry (1866-1934), of which little remains in print today. Now not much remembered except for his championship of Cezanne and his ideas of "pure form," Fry was a broad and engaging writer whose chosen medium was the lecture or essay. In addition to his leading role as apostle of Post-Impressionism, he was at home writing on architecture, decorative arts, literature, dance, and art education. Thoughtfully selected and introduced by independent scholar Reed, this collection, which includes a few previously unpublished essays, is a pleasure to read for its fresh and direct approach to works of art and movements that have long since been canonized into oblivion.

MODERN MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS WITH APPLICATIONS strikes a balance between mathematical foundations and statistical practice. Accomplished authors Jay Devore and Ken Berk first engage students with real-life problems and scenarios and then provide them with both foundational context and theory.

His travel schedule was set 18 months out. Once, he was so obsessed with impressing a potential client that he tracked down the man's travel schedule, booked the seat next to him on a flight, schmoozed the guy all the way to Australia, landed the account, and flew immediately back to Manhattan. His Type-A ways vanished when, at age 53, a top neurosurgeon in New York told him he had late-stage brain cancer. "His eyes told me I would die soon. It was late spring. I had seen my last autumn in New York."&nbsp;<br> <p>There are no TV-movie-style miracle treatments or extensions of his life expectancy; he's told he has maybe 3 months, and he doesn't spend any energy hoping for a cure. True to his CEO style, he creates goals for himself, lists of friends to visit for the last time; he meditates; he tries to create as many "perfect Moments" that he can, during dinner or phone conversations with friends, and realized how rare those moments of connection and joy were in his "previous life." <em>Chasing Daylight</em> is as much a self-criticism of his job-before-family ways as it is a meditation on time and a transition to a tranquil, spiritual state utterly foreign to him as a CEO. O'Kelly's absolutely more fulfilled by the soul work that he finishes in 100 days, compared to his 30 years of corporate promotions and accolades, and he utterly convinces readers to ponder their own situation, whether "in the gloaming" of life as he was or not. --<em>Erica Jorgensen</em></p><p><b>Eugene O'Kelly</b> started at KPMG as an assistant accountant in 1972 and ended his 30-plus year career as CEO, in which capacity he served from April 2002 to June 2005 before becoming a Senior Partner of the firm.

These years mark a period of radical innovation for the artist, during which she firmly established her commitment to abstraction. While her work in Texas is often understood as merely a prelude to her career in New York City, these watercolors and drawings mark a seminal stage in O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s artistic formation, representing the pivotal intersection of her disciplined art practice and her allegiance to the revolutionary techniques of her mentor, Arthur Wesley Dow.</p><p>O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s watercolors explore the texture and landscape of the Texas desert and the artist&#x2019;s own body in an exceptionally fragile and sensitive medium, representing a substantial achievement in their own right. These early works also relate to O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s large-scale oil paintings, which in their handling of color and texture in some ways seem to aspire to the condition of watercolor. Designed to emphasize direct contact with these beautiful works, <em>Watercolors</em> features full-scale color reproductions of the paintings, most of which are approximately 8x12 inches in scale, offering a powerful testament to the significance of the watercolors in O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s creative evolution.

This collection of essays complements an earlier, successful collection published by Cambridge, The Importance of What We Care About. These essays deal in general with foundational metaphysical and epistemological issues concerning Descartes, moral philosophy, philosophical anthropology, political philosophy, and religion. A hallmark of Frankfurt&#39;s work is his crisp and incisive style, which means that these essays should appeal to a wide range of philosophers and to readers in neighboring disciplines with philosophical interests.</p><p>&#34;Readers will be struck anew by the depth and integrity of Frankfurt&#39;s thought, as well as the sheer delight of his prose. While many will disagree sharply with Frankfurt&#39;s insistence that autonomy arises from volitional necessities that define the essential natures of persons, they will find that, like me, they cannot help but care about his work.&#34; Ethics</p><h2>A Pathway to Introductory Statistics, Books a la Carte Edition</h2><p><p><i>For a one-semester alternative to the traditional two-semester developmental algebra sequence that prepares students specifically for an Introductory Statistics course.</i></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b> </p><p><b>Looking for a new path in algebra?</b> </p><p>Using authentic data to make math meaningful to students, <b>Jay Lehmann&#x2019;s <i>A Pathway to Introductory Statistics</i> </b>provides a one-semester alternate path through developmental algebra to accelerate and prepare non-STEM students for introductory statistics.

Her refreshingly practical technique of dream interpretation has been developed over nearly twenty years of work with thousands of clients who have used her dream interview method to solve relationship problems, make business and personal decisions, overcome creative impasses, and attain greater self-understanding. Filled wit fascinating case studies and provocative ideas, <i>Breakthrough Dreaming</i> shows you:<p>What the precise meaning of any given dream is deeply individual.</p><p>How to recall and record your dreams.</p><p>How to target your dreams to solve specific problems.</p><p>Step-by-step cues for interpreting your own--and other people's--dreams.</p><p>Strategies for penetrating daytime defenses.</p><p>Separate chapters on settings, people, animals, objects, feelings, and action in your dreams.</p><p>Plus resources to further your dram study and translate your dream insights into a richer and more productive waking life.</p>Here, Gayle Delaney, founder of the Association for the Study of Dreams and dream theory researcher for over 20 years, offers techniques for dream interpretation to enhance creativity and to help deal with problems. This book shows how to understand the metaphoric language of dreams through a host of specific examples: dream settings, people, animals, feelings and events. But the focus is on learning to apply the insights you gain to solve problems and fine-tune your judgment. She presents the dream interview process as a method we can learn to use on ourselves and with others. What emerges here is a vision of a state of being in which each of us can access the meanings of our dreams, help others to do so and achieve an open channel between waking and dreaming. -- <i>From The WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women; review by Ilene Rosoff</i></p><h2>Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: An Anthology of Suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya</h2><p>Drawn from the Anguttara Nikaya, Numerical Discourses of the Buddha brings together teachings of the Buddha ranging from basic ethical observances recommended to the busy man or woman of the world, to the more rigorous instructions on mental training prescribed for the monks and nuns. The Anguttara Nikaya is a part of the Pali Canon, the authorized recension of the Buddha&#39;s Word for followers of Theravada Buddhism, the form of Buddhism prevailing in the Buddhist countries of southern Asia.</p><p><b>Nyanaponika Thera</b> (1901-94) was one of the foremost interpreters of Theravada Buddhism in our time. His books include <i>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation</i>, <i>The Vision of Dhamma</i> and <i>Abhidhamma Studies</i>. <br><br><b>Bhikkhu Bodhi</b> is an American Buddhist monk from New York City, ordained in Sri Lanka in 1972. He is currently the president and editor of the Buddhist Publication Society. His books include <i>The All-embracing Net of Views</i>, <i>A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma</i>, and (as editor and reviser) <i>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</i>.This translation of sections of the <i>Anguttara Nikaya</i> is a welcome addition to Pali canonical studies. The anthology, drawn from all sections of this voluminous work, represents approximately a fifth of the entire text. The translation is readable and literary, intended explicity for a nonspecialist audience. Nyanoponika Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi successfully aid their readers in navigating this opaque work, which is organized not by theme but by the numerical schema presented in each discourse. Introductory essays, which provide a historical overview of the Pali canon and survey fundamental Buddhist doctrines, set a useful context for the translation. The translations themselves are well annotated with careful and informative endnotes. This work&#x2014;appropriate for students at varying levels of expertise&#x2014;is a valuable and approachable resource for investigating the wide variety of teachings and diverse formats of the Pali canon.

The authors cover the major institutions, actors, and processes that comprise the U.S. legal system, viewed from a political science perspective. Grounding their presentation in empirical social science terms, the authors identify popular myths about the structure and processes of American law and courts and then contrast those myths with what really takes place. Three unique elements of this "myth versus reality" framework are incorporated into each of the topical chapters:</p> <p></p> <p>1) "Myth versus Reality" boxes that lay out the topics each chapter covers, using the myths about each topic contrasted with the corresponding realities.</p> <p></p> <p>2) "Pop Culture" boxes that provide students with popular examples from film, television, and music that tie-in to chapter topics and engage student interest.</p> <p></p> <p>3) "How Do We Know?" boxes that discuss the methods of social scientific inquiry and debunk common myths about the judiciary and legal system.</p> <p></p> <p>Unlike other textbooks, American Judicial Process emphasizes how pop culture portrays&#x2015;and often distorts&#x2015;the judicial process and how social science research is brought to bear to provide an accurate picture of law and courts. In addition, a rich companion website will include PowerPoint lectures, suggested topics for papers and projects, a test bank of objective questions for use by instructors, and downloadable artwork from the book. Students will have access to annotated web links and videos, flash cards of key terms, and a glossary.</p></p><p><p><strong>Pamela C.

The movie concerns a brave fishing-boat captain in World War II-era Martinique who aids the French Resistance, battles the Nazis, and gets the girl in the end. The novel concerns a broke fishing-boat captain who agrees to carry contraband between Cuba and Florida in order to feed his wife and daughters. Of the two, the novel is by far the darker, more complex work.<p> The first time we meet Harry Morgan, he is sitting in a Havana bar watching a gun battle raging out in the street. After seeing a Cuban get his head blown off with a Luger, Morgan reacts with typical Hemingway understatement: "I took a quick one out of the first bottle I saw open and I couldn't tell you yet what it was. The whole thing made me feel pretty bad." Still feeling bad, Harry heads out in his boat on a charter fishing expedition for which he is later stiffed by the client. With not even enough money to fill his gas tanks, he is forced to agree to smuggle some illegal Chinese for the mysterious Mr. Sing. From there it's just a small step to carrying liquor--a disastrous run that ends when Harry loses an arm and his boat. Once Harry gets mixed up in the brewing Cuban revolution, however, even those losses seem small compared to what's at stake now: his very life.</p><p> Hemingway tells most of this story in the third person, but, significantly, he brackets the whole with a section at the beginning told from Harry's perspective and a short, heart-wrenching chapter at the end narrated by his wife, Marie. In between there is adventure, danger, betrayal, and death, but this novel begins and ends with the tough and tender portrait of a man who plays the cards that are dealt him with courage and dignity, long after hope is gone. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Valley of Fear (The Oxford Sherlock Holmes)</h2><p>A cipher message and a horrible murder in a Sussex village begin this dark and powerful tale in which Holmes battles with the forces of the criminal mastermind, Professor Moriarity.

Now Brenda E. Stevenson presents a reality far more gripping than popular legend, even as she challenges the conventional wisdom of academic historians. <em>Life in Black and White</em> provides a panoramic portrait of family and community life in and around Loudoun County, Virginia--weaving the fascinating personal stories of planters and slaves, of free blacks and poor-to-middling whites, into a powerful portrait of southern society from the mid-eighteenth century to the Civil War.<br> Loudoun County and its vicinity encapsulated the full sweep of southern life. Here the region's most illustrious families--the Lees, Masons, Carters, Monroes, and Peytons--helped forge southern traditions and attitudes that became characteristic of the entire region while mingling with yeoman farmers of German, Scotch-Irish, and Irish descent, and free black families who lived alongside abolitionist Quakers and thousands of slaves. Stevenson brilliantly recounts their stories as she builds the complex picture of their intertwined lives, revealing how their combined histories guaranteed Loudon's role in important state, regional, and national events and controversies. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, for example, were hidden at a local plantation during the War of 1812. James Monroe wrote his famous "Doctrine" at his Loudon estate. The area also was the birthplace of celebrated fugitive slave Daniel Dangerfield, the home of John Janney, chairman of the Virginia secession convention, a center for Underground Railroad activities, and the location of John Brown's infamous 1859 raid at Harpers Ferry.<br> In exploring the central role of the family, Brenda Stevenson offers a wealth of insight: we look into the lives of upper class women, who bore the oppressive weight of marriage and motherhood as practiced in the South and the equally burdensome roles of their husbands whose honor was tied to their ability to support and lead regardless of their personal preference; the yeoman farm family's struggle for respectability; and the marginal economic existence of free blacks and its undermining influence on their family life.<br> Most important, Stevenson breaks new ground in her depiction of slave family life. Following the lead of historian Herbert Gutman, most scholars have accepted the idea that, like white, slaves embraced the nuclear family, both as a living reality and an ideal. Stevenson destroys this notion, showing that the harsh realities of slavery, even for those who belonged to such attentive masters as George Washington, allowed little possibility of a nuclear family. Far more important were extended kin networks and female headed households.<br>Meticulously researched, insightful, and moving, <em>Life in Black and White</em> offers our most detailed portrait yet of the reality of southern life. It forever changes our understanding of family and race relations during the reign of the peculiar institution in the American South.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brenda E. Stevenson</strong>, a native of Virginia, is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, Los Angeles. She is the editor of <em>The Journals of Charlotte Forten Grimke.</em><br>YA?Stevenson uses diaries, letters, journals, and other firsthand accounts to describe the lives of a variety of people in Loudon County, VA, including slaveholders, slaves, free blacks, and poor whites, during the decades between the Revolution and the Civil War. The material is clearly organized and the writing is easily understood. Section one deals with white citizens and includes family life, gender roles, courtship and marriage, and parenting. The second half of the book focuses on African Americans and analyzes the nature of slavery, black family structure, slave marriage, and the lives of free blacks. Because Stevenson focuses on several prominent families, readers will gain insight into the mind-set of several generations of slaveholders. She creates an interesting portrait of the society of the time. Most gripping, however, are her descriptions of the lives of slaves. Narratives of severe physical punishment and rape are eye opening and stress the atrocities of the system.

C. S. Rolls (of Rolls Royce), Winston Churchill, Harold Nicolson, and Vita Sackville-West, and changing our perceptions of them - transforming wastrels into heroes and the self-satisfied into the second-rate.<br>Cannadine begins by investigating the land-owning classes as a whole during the last two hundred years, describing their origins, their habits, their increasing debts, and their involvement with the steam train, the horseless carriage, and the aeroplane. He next focuses on patricians he finds particularly fascinating: Lord Curzon, an unrivalled ceremonial impresario and inventor of traditions; Lord Strickland, part English landowner and part Mediterranean nobleman, who was both an imperial proconsul and prime minister of Malta; and Winston Churchill, whom Cannadine sees as an aristocratic adventurer, a man who was burdened by, more than he benefitted from, his family connections and patrician attitudes. Cannadine then moves from individuals to aristocratic dynasties. He reconstructs the extraordinary financial history of the dukes of Devonshire, narrates the story of the Cozens-Hardys, a Norfolk family who played a remarkably varied part in the life of their county, and offers a controversial reappraisal of the forebears, lives, work, and personalities of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West - a portrait, notes Cannadine, of more than a marriage.<br>Written with sympathy and irony, devoid of snobbery or nostalgia, and handsomely illustrated, Cannadine's book is sure both to enlighten and delight.</p><p>David Cannadine has taught at Columbia University, New York, where he is now Moore Collegiate Professor of History.Cannadine (The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, Doubleday, 1992) offers this set of "occasional pieces," written over the period 1977-93, which serve the purpose of filling in background for the larger work. The essays are divided into three sections: an overview of class issues in modern Britain; an examination of unusual examples of the aristocratic family unit, including the now-famous unorthodox marriage of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West; and a profile of less well known aspects of individuals' lives and careers. Included in this latter section are Lord Curzon's penchant for organizing ceremonial occasions, Lord Strickland's career in Malta and Tasmania, and the scandals of some of the less savory members of Winston Churchill's family. While they are most likely to appeal to those with some background in the subject matter, the essays are written in a lively style that should have broad appeal.

Moreover, the lay public needs to be educated in its basic principles, particularly since epidemiologic research involves human subjects and their participation is vital for valid results and inferences. Therefore, a book like this is extremely important to the field.</p><b>Audience: </b>It addresses a large audience interested in epidemiology as a basic science for disease prevention and an important part of public health policy development and evaluation. The author targets a broad group of professionals in different disciplines, as well as the public at large. It is useful not only for a large variety of students (from health sciences to legal disciplines), but also for public health and medical practitioners who are interested in keeping up-to-date with epidemiologic research applicable to their specialty. The author has vast experience, not only in medical and epidemiologic research, but also in teaching.&nbsp; <p><b>Features: </b>The book's three main sections flow in a logical manner. The first one introduces the different approaches to measure disease occurrence and explains the importance of measuring health-related outcomes. The second section presents epidemiologic methods in evaluating the relationship between risk/protective factors and disease occurrence and establishing causality. The last section, an important part of the book, emphasizes epidemiology's applications for public health programs and policies. The appendix helps readers link information from different parts of the book and the pictures and graphs help in understanding the text. The organization of the book is a clever way of introducing readers to basic epidemiology principles and methods.</p>&nbsp;<b>Assessment: </b>The fourth edition presents important updates in a very dynamic field and introduces the new approaches in study design. The color pictures and graphs make the concepts clearer and easier to follow most of the time. As more and more professionals use epidemiologic principles, an updated and easier to use edition of this book is valuable. I strongly recommend it.</p><h2>Plant Physiology, 4th Edition</h2><p>Plant Physiology, Fourth Edition continues to set the standard for textbooks in the field, making plant physiology accessible to virtually every student.

A foundling, Tom is discovered one evening by the benevolent Squire Allworthy and his sister Bridget and brought up as a son in their household until it is time for him to set out in search of both his fortune and his true identity.<br><br>Amorous, high-spirited, and filled with what Fielding called "the glorious lust of doing good" but with a tendency toward dissolution, Tom Jones is one of the first characters in fiction to display legitimate sides of human virtue and vice. "Upon my word, I think Tom Jones is one of the most perfect plots ever planned," said Samuel Taylor Coleridge.<br><br>Now, Tom Jones has been brought to television in a magnificent new co-production from A&amp;E Network and BBC television. Max Beesley stars as Tom, with Samantha Morton (who appeared in A&amp;E's Emma and Jane Eyre) as Sophia. The cast also includes Benjamin Whitrow, Brian Blessed, Frances De La Tour, and John Sessions. Tom Jones is directed by Metin Huseyin, produced by Suzan Harrison, with a screenplay by Simon Burke.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p>Tom Jones isn&#39;t a bad guy, but boys just want to have fun.

Although his theories remain controversial until this day, Freud made a lasting impact on Western culture.</p><h2>The Little Tragedies</h2><p>In a major burst of creativity, Russian poet Alexander Pushkin during just three months in 1830 completed <i>Eugene Onegin, </i>composed more than thirty lyric poems, wrote several short stories and folk tales, and penned the four short dramas in verse that comprise the &#x201c;little tragedies.&#x201d; The &#x201c;little tragedies&#x201d; stand among the great masterpieces of Russian literature, yet they were last translated into English a quarter-century ago and have in recent years been out of print entirely. In this outstanding new translation, Nancy K. Anderson preserves the cadence and intensity of Pushkin&#x2019;s work while aligning it with today&#x2019;s poetic practices and freer approach to metrics. In addition she provides critical essays examining each play in depth, a discussion of her approach to translating the plays, and a consideration of the genre of these dramatic pieces and their performability.<br><br>The four &#x201c;little tragedies&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Mozart and Salieri, </i><i>The Miserly Knight, </i><i>The Stone Guest, </i>and <i>A Feast During the Plague&#x2014;</i>are extremely compressed dialogues, each dealing with a dominant protagonist whose central internal conflict determines both the plot and structure of the play. Pushkin focuses on human passions and the interplay between free will and fate: though each protagonist could avoid self-ruin, instead he freely chooses it.</p><p>Nancy K. Anderson is an independent scholar in New Haven, Connecticut.Pushkin's four dramatic scenes in verse, known as The Little Tragedies, are skillfully translated by Anderson, an independent scholar. Written in 1830, these pieces include "The Miserly Knight," "Mozart and Salieri," "The Stone Guest," and "A Feast During the Plague." The theme of inner conflict dominates them all. Compared with Vladimir Nabokov's 1944 translation of three of the tragedies, Anderson's are more fluid, with flexible meters that will please contemporary English readers. The use of short scenes makes these translations suitable for acting. The translated text consists of only 66 pages; in addition, Anderson provides a scholarly introduction, four critical essays on each of the tragedies with line-by-line interpretations, and brief commentaries and notes for each tragedy. The book provides refreshing reading and scholarly research in one. Recommended for all academic and large public libraries.DMing-ming Shen Kuo, Ball State Univ.

Boasting a cast of extraordinary and eccentric personalities, including the heroine Do�a Rita, this is a story of adventure on the high seas, of the revelation of love, of the crushing weight of loss, and of freedom found in the recklessness of unadorned sincerity.</p><p>During the Carlist war of the early 1870s, a young sailor, the unnamed protagonist, joins the champions of Don Carlos de Bourbon, pretender to the throne of Spain. The Carlists use the eager youth's intense attraction to the sea to persuade him to run perilous enterprises for their cause, ventures he later learns have been financed by the beautiful mistress and heiress of a rich man's fortune. When he falls in love with her, he finds himself moved absolutely by this discovery, despite the fact that she is unable to return his love fully. In the end he is left alone with his first love, the sea, his brief time with the mysterious Do�a Rita marking a tumultuous awakening to a life of passion, the desolation that hides in its shadow, and the possibility of rebirth in its wake.</p><p>Although not as well known as his earlier novels <i>Lord Jim</i> and <i>Nostromo</i>, <i>The Arrow of Gold</i> was critically acclaimed when it first appeared in 1919 and is still considered to be among the best of Conrad's later works.</p></p><p><b>Joseph Conrad</b> was born Theodor Jozef Konrad Korzeniowski in 1857 in the Ukraine.

Drawing on the work of James Joyce, Sigmund Freud's patient 'Dora' and the case of Oscar Schindler, Richard Kearney skilfully illuminates how stories not only entertain us but can determine our lives and personal identities. He also considers nations as stories, including the story of Romulus and Remus in the founding of Rome. Throughout, <em>On Stories</em> stresses that, far from heralding the demise of narrative, the digital era merely opens up new stories.</p><p>Richard Kearney is Professor of Philosophy at University College Dublin and Boston College. He is co-editor of the Thinking in Action series....a paean to storytelling....The voice is clear, humane and level-headed. Kearney serves as an guide through this brief history of the ways stories have worked, for better or for worse, in our lives..</p><h2>Hamlet (Dover Large Print Classics)</h2><p><p>In this quintessential Shakespeare tragedy, a young prince's halting pursuit of revenge for the murder of his father unfolds in a series of highly charged confrontations that have held audiences spellbound for nearly four centuries. Those fateful exchanges, and the anguished soliloquies that precede and follow them, probe depths of human feeling rarely sounded in any art.<br>The title role of Hamlet, perhaps the most demanding in all of Western drama, has provided generations of leading actors their greatest challenge. Yet all the roles in this towering drama are superbly delineated, and each of the key scenes offers actors a rare opportunity to create theatrical magic.<br>As if further evidence of Shakespeare's genius were needed, <i>Hamlet</i> is a unique pleasure to read as well as to see and hear performed. The full text of this extraordinary drama is reprinted here from an authoritative British edition complete with illuminating footnotes.<br>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.</p></p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.</p><h2>The Night in Question: Stories</h2><p>Well before his memoirs This Boy&#39;s Life and In Pharaoh&#39;s Army were published to great acclaim, Tobias Wolff had already proven himself one of America&#39;s foremost short story writers.

Why? In John McMurry&#39;s words: &#34;I have been asked hundreds of times over the past ten years why I wrote this book. I wrote this book because I love writing. I get great pleasure and satisfaction from taking a complicated subject, turning it around until I see it clearly from a new angle, and then explaining it in simple words. I write to explain chemistry to students the way I wish it had been explained to me years ago.&#34; Through his lucid writing and ability to show the beauty and logic of organic chemistry, McMurry makes learning enjoyable for students. The highest compliment that can be given to a chemistry book applies to McMurry: It works! Mainstream in level, McMurry&#39;s coverage is concise yet doesn&#39;t omit any key topics. McMurry blends the traditional functional-group approach with a mechanistic approach. The primary approach, by functional group, begins with the simple and progresses to the more complex so that readers who are not yet versed in the subtleties of mechanisms are first exposed to the &#34;what&#34; of chemistry before beginning to grapple with the &#34;why.&#34; Within this primary organization, the author places a heavy emphasis on explaining the fundamental mechanistic similarities. In this edition, McMurry retains his standard-setting features (including his innovative vertical format for explaining reaction mechanisms) while revising his text line-by-line to include hundreds of small but important improvements. For example, the Sixth Edition includes new examples, additional steps in existing examples, new problems, new phrases to clarify the exposition, and a vibrant new art program. In addition, new icons in the text lead students to a variety of new online resources. McMurry&#39;s text is in use at hundreds of colleges and universities around the world, from North America, to the United Kingdom and the Pacific Rim.</p><p>John E. McMurry received his B.A. from Harvard University and his Ph.D. at Columbia University. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Foundation Fellow. He has received several awards, which include the National Institutes of Health Career Development Award, the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Scientist Award, and the Max Planck Research Award. In addition to ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, he is also the author or coauthor of ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: A BIOLOGICAL APPROACH, FUNDAMENTALS OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, THE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OF BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS.</p><h2>Agnes Grey, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall: Introduction by Lucy Hughes-Hallett (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p>The only one-volume hardcover edition of the two uncommonly powerful novels written by the youngest of the famous Bront� sisters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anne Bront� wrote these two fantastically successful novels just before her tragically early death, both of them in a much more grittily realistic mode than the more romantic ones favored by her sisters. <i>Agnes Grey, </i>the story of a governess working for disdainful and cruel employers, is a wrenching account of the desperate straits faced by Victorian women without money or husband. <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall </i>tells a story that was shocking for its time: a woman leaves her alcoholic and abusive husband in order to protect their young son and must live in hiding to prevent the law from taking her child away from her. These novels have become classics not only by dint of the subtle and ironic force of Anne Bront�'s prose but because of the passionate indictments of social injustice that animate them.</p><p>ANNE BRONT� (1820-1849) was the youngest sister of Charlotte and Emily Bront�. After working as a governess, she wrote a book of poetry with her sisters and these two novels before dying of tuberculosis at age twenty-nine.<br><br>Introduction by Lucy Hughes-Hallet</p><h2>The Age of Responsibility: Luck, Choice, and the Welfare State</h2><p><p>A novel focus on &#x201c;personal responsibility&#x201d; has transformed political thought and public policy in America and Europe. Since the 1970s, responsibility&#x2015;which once meant the moral duty to help and support others&#x2015;has come to suggest an obligation to be self-sufficient. This narrow conception of responsibility has guided recent reforms of the welfare state, making key entitlements conditional on good behavior. Drawing on intellectual history, political theory, and moral philosophy, Yascha Mounk shows why the Age of Responsibility is pernicious&#x2015;and how it might be overcome.</p><p>Personal responsibility began as a conservative catchphrase. But over time, leaders across the political spectrum came to subscribe to its underlying framework. Today, even egalitarian philosophers rarely question the normative importance of responsibility. Emphasizing the pervasive influence of luck over our lives, they cast the poor as victims who cannot be held responsible for their actions.</p><p>Mounk shows that today&#x2019;s focus on individual culpability is both wrong and counterproductive: it distracts us from the larger economic forces determining aggregate outcomes, ignores what we owe our fellow citizens regardless of their choices, and blinds us to other key values, such as the desire to live in a society of equals. Recognizing that even society&#x2019;s neediest members seek to exercise genuine agency, Mounk builds a positive conception of responsibility. Instead of punishing individuals for their past choices, he argues, public policy should aim to empower them to take responsibility for themselves&#x2015;and those around them.</p></p><p>Yascha Mounk is Associate Professor of the Practice of International Affairs at Johns Hopkins University, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, and a senior advisor at Protect Democracy. A frequent contributor to the <i>Atlantic</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and <i>Die Zeit</i>, he is the host of <i>Slate</i>&#x2019;s <i>The Good Fight Podcast</i>.&#x201c;A terrific book. The insight at its heart&#x2015;that we live in an &#x2018;age of responsibility,&#x2019; and that the conception of responsibility now at work in much public rhetoric and policy is both punitive and ill-conceived&#x2015;is very important and should be widely heeded.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jedediah Purdy, author of <i>After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Yascha Mounk traces the faltering legitimacy of the welfare state to the narrow notion of personal responsibility that politicians&#x2015;and many philosophers&#x2015;have come to embrace. In a compelling challenge to conservatives and liberals alike, this important book prompts us to reconsider the role of luck and choice in debates about welfare, and to rethink our mutual responsibilities as citizens.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael J. Sandel, author of <i>What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] smart and engaging book...Does it make sense, [Mounk] wonders, to focus so much on whether a sick poor person is responsible for not having acquired health insurance? Given that studies suggest public health and economic growth would benefit if he (and others like him) had coverage, shouldn&#x2019;t we consider providing it regardless of whether he &#x2018;deserves&#x2019; it? Or do we so value holding people accountable that we are willing to jeopardize our own welfare for a proper comeuppance? ...Mounk contends [that] too many advocates unwittingly accept the punitive framework of accountability and, following its logic, end up patronizing those they want to help.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Ryerson</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] important new book...Over the course of the past half century, Mounk points out, political officials of both major parties have turned repeatedly to the core value of personal responsibility, calling on it to redefine the purposes and design of government as well as pushing the state to play an ever more disciplinary role in relation to its most vulnerable citizens. They have been motivated, Mounk suggests, not merely by a political agenda, but by a fantasy of the just social order&#x2015;a vision in which each individual person cares for herself and the government acts to ensure that citizens receive only the public support their efforts merit. The dream, as Mounk reveals, is a narrow and crabbed one. Placed under his precise and dispassionate analysis, it shows itself to be conceptually dubious and empirically unworkable. But the fantasy has attracted plenty of influential adherents. Indeed, among the most troubling of Mounk&#x2019;s arguments is the claim that the liberal defenders of the welfare state no less than its conservative antagonists have signed on to the dream of personal responsibility. No surprise, then, that a thin theory of individual agency has come to dominate our ideas about freedom and that an impoverished language of citizenship has crowded out alternative visions of democratic society...He mounts a compelling case, that political rhetoric in the United States&#x2015;and to a lesser, but still significant degree in other industrialized democracies&#x2015;has shifted over the last half century toward a markedly punitive vision of social welfare. This trend has coincided with policy transformations that have served to discipline individual citizens by demanding that they bear the costs of their own behavior and the risks of a hazardous world. The age of responsibility, in this view, is not only the period that brought us workfare and conditional unemployment benefits&#x2015;and, one might add, mass incarceration...Where ideas of the public good or of shared responsibility once prevailed, private interest is now the presumptive guide.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sean McCann</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Impressive, frequently charming...It seems aimed to appeal well beyond the philosophical community, with hopes of motivating a thoughtful and concerned readership to revamp the way our conception of &#x2018;personal responsibility&#x2019; functions in political and social life. The book employs a fair amount of extant philosophical work to provoke a change in our public discourse and practices, while also performing some creative philosophical work that might be of interest to disciplinary philosophers. It is overall an erudite and enjoyably readable book...Mounk&#x2019;s book is a laudable and fruitful achievement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Scott Anderson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</i></b></p><h2>READING 2007 GRAMMAR AND WRITING PRACTICE BOOK GRADE 6 (Reading Street)</h2><p>Scientifically research-based program supports state standards in literacy, science, mathematics, social studies, art and music to prepare children for Kindergarten.

Bands needed theaters to play in, music promoters needed to get the word out about the shows, and a group of talented young artists producing dreamy, free-form work needed a medium of expression. Thus was born the psychedelic rock poster, one of the most explosively inventive, instantly recognizable, and profoundly influential aesthetic movements of the last century. A group of young visual artists provided perfectly trippy visuals to accompany soundtracks by bands like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Santana, the Doors, and many more. These artists--including Lee Conklin, Rick Griffin, Alton Kelley, Bonnie Maclean, Victor Moscoso, Stanley Mouse, Wes Wilson, and others created a new artistic genre: the collectible rock concert poster. Some are household names today while others are largely forgotten, but the poster art that gave visual life to the amazing music lives on in <em>Dreams Unreal</em>.</p></p><p>Artist, writer, and curator <strong>Titus O'Brien</strong> has exhibited his work internationally as well as curated exhibitions for a range of for- and nonprofit art spaces. He has taught studio art, art history, and creative writing at the University of Texas, Columbia College Chicago, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, among other institutions. As a curator at the Albuquerque Museum, his exhibitions included <em>Hard Edge Abstraction</em>, <em>Spirit of Creation: Works by Contemporary Native American Artists</em>, <em>The Taos Moderns</em>, and <em>Dreams Unreal</em>.</p><h2>Engineering Geology: Rock in Engineering Construction</h2><p>Provides a concrete understanding of the basic facts and experiences relating to the different behavior of rock types in engineering construction.

The focus on power and purpose engages both the goals that actors have in international politics, and the ways they have to achieve them. Thought-provoking case studies and features on history, policy, and geography let you see the world from multiple perspectives, while critical-thinking questions for each feature ask you to examine what you have learned. The Connection to You boxes show how international politics directly affects the lives of individuals, and how individuals can influence international politics.</p><p>Paul D&#39;Anieri, a professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, has taught international politics for over 25 years.

He is also the author of ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE IN UKRAINIAN-RUSSIAN RELATIONS; UNDERSTANDING UKRAINIAN POLITICS: POWER, POLITICS, AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN; and POLITICS AND SOCIETY IN UKRAINE. In addition, his articles have appeared in numerous academic journals and books on Eastern European politics.

In short, the overall format is attractive."</p><h2>The Iliad and The Odyssey Boxed Set</h2><p>Odyssey, The/Iliad, The boxed set (Penguin Classics) ASIN: 0670779644</p><p>This is a boxed gift edition of Fagles's two widely acclaimed translations of Homer.<p> <i>The Iliad</i> is typically described as one of the greatest war stories of all time, but to call it a war story does not begin to describe the emotional sweep of its action and characters: Achilles, Helen, Hector, and other heroes of Greek myth and history in the 10th and final year of the Greek siege of Troy. <i>The Odyssey</i> is, quite simply, the story of Odysseus, who wants to go home. But Poseidon, god of oceans, doesn't want him to make it back across the wine-dark sea to his wife, Penelope, son, Telemachus, and their high-roofed home at Ithaca. The story is told in easy-going, beautiful poetry; the characters speak naturally, the action happens briskly. Even the gods come across as real people, despite the divine powers they exercise constantly. Both works have been hailed by scholars and the public for the powerful language that brings clashing, pulsing life to these ancient masterpieces.</p><b>Now available again&#x2014;a beautiful hardcover gift set of Robert Fagles&#x2019;s award-winning translations of Homer</b> <p> <b>Translated by Robert Fagles<br> Introduction and notes by Bernard Knox</b> </p><p> Praise for <i>The Iliad:</i><br> "Plain and direct, noble, above all rapid . . . leading the reader forward with an irresistible flow. More readable than Lattimore or Fitzgerald, and more performable . . . <br> [Fagles&#x2019;s] version is imbued with humanity." <br> &#x2014;Oliver Taplin, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> </p><p> "Tremendous eloquence . . . An <i>Iliad</i> primed for grandeur." <br> &#x2014;Douglass Parker, <i>The New Republic</i> </p><p> Praise for <i>The Odyssey:</i><br> "Robert Fagles is the best living translator of ancient Greek drama, lyric poetry, and epic into modern English, and his translation of <i>The Odyssey</i> is his finest work so far." <br> &#x2014;Garry Wills, <i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p> "A memorable achievement . . . Mr. Fagles has been remarkably successful in finding a style that is of our time and yet timeless." <br> &#x2014;Richard Jenkyns, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Approaches to Group Work: A Handbook for Practitioners</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Intended as a supplement to a theoretical counseling book, this handbook presents twenty-three practical approaches to working with children, adolescents, and adults on such goals as making friends, succeeding in school, planning a career, and being a good parent. Taken together, these ideas will well equip future counselors to address a variety of issues in a wide range of settings. <b> </b> This book covers the standard presentation for each approach&#x2014;Consisting of purpose statement, conceptual framework, goals, pre-screening and orientation, outline for eight sessions, evaluation experience, and referral/follow-up plans. <b> </b> For professionals in the field of counseling. </p></p><p><p> <b> <i>David Capuzzi,</i></b><i> </i> Ph.D., N.C.C., L.P.C., is a past president of the American Counseling Association (formerly the American Association for Counseling and Development) and is professor and coordinator of Counselor Education in the Graduate School of Education at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. </p> <p> A former editor of The School Counselor, Dr. Capuzzi has authored a number of textbook chapters and monographs on the topic of preventing adolescent suicide and is coeditor and author, with Dr. Larry Golden, of <i>Helping Families Help Children: Family Interventions with School Related Problems</i> and <i>Preventing Adolescent Suicide.</i> He co-authored and edited <i>Youth at Risk: A Prevention Resource for Counselors, Teachers, and Parents; Introduction to the Counseling Profession; Introduction to Group Counseling</i> and <i>Counseling and Psychotherapy: Theories and Interventions</i> with Douglas R. Gross. He has authored or co-authored articles in a number of ACA-related journals. </p> <p> A frequent speaker and keynoter at professional conferences and institutes, Dr. Capuzzi has also consulted with a variety of school districts and community agencies interested in initiating prevention and intervention strategies for adolescents at risk for suicide. He has facilitated the development of suicide prevention, crisis management, and post intervention programs in communities throughout the United States; provides training on the topics of "youth at risk" and "grief and loss"; and serves as an invited adjunct faculty member at other universities as time permits. He is the first recipient of ACA's Kitty Cole Human Rights Award. </p><p> The role of a professional counselor calls for practitioners who have the knowledge and skills to assist clients as they strive to attain higher levels of self-understanding, problem solving, relationship building, and planning for the future. Counselors in school, community/mental health, hospital, private practice, rehabilitation, business and industry, and a variety of other agency settings are called upon to deliver a variety of services to a culturally diverse and challenging clientele comprising children, adolescents, and adults. In many instances, clients can be well served through the provision of task, psychoeducational, counseling, or psychotherapy groups. Counselors and therapists must master the basic knowledge and skill competencies needed to facilitate groups in order to meet the needs of a substantive segment of their clients served in particular settings and to obtain positions in those settings. Ability to do group work with clients is essential to beginning and experienced professionals committed to providing the constellation of services their clients deserve. </p> <p> This handbook is unique in several ways. The 23 authors of the approaches to groups included in this resource are all residents of the Pacific Northwest. They represent a wide range of interests as well as expertise spanning a 40-year continuum from the beginning to the experienced professional. Except for one faculty contributor, all were members of a graduate student cohort in the counselor education program in the Graduate School of Education at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. </p> <p> The models for group facilitation presented in this handbook were created for implementation with specific age groups in either the work settings or proposed internship sites of the authors. Each author used the following paradigm to plan the group interventions described: statement of purpose, conceptual framework, goals for the group, plans for pre-group screening and orientation, descriptions for eight group sessions, evaluation of the group experience, and plans for referral and follow-up. </p> <p> Even though no two professionals facilitate groups in exactly the same way, each author provides a thorough description of each of the eight sessions so that other practitioners can follow the same format. The purpose, theme, and materials needed for each session are addressed. In addition, each author described the "process" variables that should be taken into consideration to enhance the opportunity for participation by each member of the group and to focus the group experience in constructive and therapeutic ways. In all cases, it is also true that the interventions described probably exceed what could be accomplished in just eight sessions and that those using this resource will find that each group intervention could take considerably longer than eight sessions to complete. In part, this is based on a shared philosophy that it is better to "over plan and under use" so that the plan or format for the group does not begin to take precedence over the needs of group members during a given session. </p> <p> Part 1 of this handbook describes approaches to group work with children, Part 2 describes approaches to group work with adolescents, and Part 3 describes approaches to group work with adults. This handbook can be used by graduate students in counselor education, psychology, and social work as a practical adjunct to a more theoretical text used in the process of preparing the group-work specialist. </p> <p> In addition, <i>Approaches to Group Work: A Handbook for Practitioners</i> can also be helpful to professionals who have completed their graduate degrees and wish to continue developing the knowledge and skills base needed for the successful facilitation of groups. </p></p><h2>The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs</h2><p><i>The Mind of Egypt</i> presents an unprecedented account of the mainsprings of Egyptian civilization--the ideals, values, mentalities, belief systems, and aspirations that shaped the first territorial state in human history. Drawing on a range of literary, iconographic, and archaeological sources, the renowned historian Jan Assmann reconstructs a world of unparalleled complexity, a culture that, long before others, possessed an extraordinary degree of awareness and self-reflection.</p><p>"Writing a history of the development of the ancient Egyptian mind," wrote the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt a century and a half ago, is "an impossibility." Today, observes Jan Assmann, we know "infinitely more about Egypt" than did the scholars of Burckhardt's day. But, even so, the ancient Egyptian mind continues to elude us.<p> Turning to what he calls "the hidden face of history," Assmann explores the meaning of the Egyptian past to the ancients themselves. For them, history, that chronicle of pharaohs and empires, began with the recognition that humans, not gods or demigods, controlled earthly affairs. From the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the time of the Ptolemy dynasty, the idea of the state was central to Egyptians' view of themselves in the world. With this centralized power, Assmann argues, grew other ideas, such as the notion that the stone of the pyramids was "an eternalized form of the body" and that our short time on earth was "something more akin to a dream than to reality." Full of learned discussions on such matters as the origins and development of hieroglyphic writing and the evolution of funereal architecture, Assmann's book offers a fascinating view of ancient history, and of ancient ways of thinking. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Jan Assmann is Professor of Egyptology at the University of Heidelberg.</p><h2>A Concise History of the American Republic: Volume 1</h2><p><em>A Concise History of the American Republic</em>, Second Edition, is a compact, authoritative, gracefully written narrative of American history from the arrival of the Native Americans' Siberian forebears to the economic conflicts of the Carter and Reagan administrations.

This brilliant, culturally resonant fiction was written towards the end of Tolstoy&#x2019;s life, but the conflict it describes has obvious, ironic parallels with current affairs today. It is 1852, and Hadji Murat, one of the most feared mountain chiefs, is the scourge of the Russian army. When he comes to surrender, the Russians are delighted.

By retelling our personal, family, and cultural narratives we can transform the patterns of our own lives as well as the patterns that shape our communities and the larger social worlds in which we interact. <br> <br>Applying the latest neuroscience research on memory, brain mapping, and brain plasticity to the field of narrative therapy, Lewis Mehl-Madrona and Barbara Mainguy explain how the brain is specialized in the art of story-making and story-telling. They detail mind-mapping and narrative therapy techniques that use story to change behavior patterns in ourselves, our relationships, and our communities. They explore studies that reveal how memory works through story, how the brain recalls things in narrative rather than lists, and how our stories modify our physiology and facilitate health or disease. Drawing on their decades of experience in narrative therapy, the authors examine the art of helping people to change their story, providing brain-mapping practices to discover your inner storyteller and test if the stories you are living are functional or dysfunctional, healing or destructive. They explain how to create new characters and new stories, ones that excite you, help you connect with yourself, and deepen your intimate connections with others. <br> <br>Detailing how shared stories and language form culture, the authors also explore how narrative therapy can help replace dysfunctional cultural stories with those that offer templates for healthier relationships with each other and the planet.</p><p>Lewis Mehl-Madrona, M.D., Ph.D., is a physician, associate professor at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine, and executive director of the Coyote Institute for Studies of Change and Transformation.

Memory is required to achieve an overall sense of coherence for a story, at least in part by allowing us to track the relations between near and distant clauses within that story. The same neurons associated with hearing a story continue to be active for a time after the story ends, supporting the idea that we hold the story in working memory. The frontal lobe is the brain region that best performs this function (Rolls 2000). Neuroimaging studies coupled with studies of brain-damaged people help us better localize the parts of the brain <i>necessary</i> for a given function (Cabeza &amp; Nyberg 2000). <br> <br>Retrieving personal memories that occur as associations to a story is important. These memories tend to be more actively self-oriented when elicited by what we consider to be fiction as compared to what we consider to be news (Larsen &amp; Seilman 1988). <br><b> <br>Why Do We Need to Understand Stories?</b> <br> <br>Human experience is embedded in stories, which we understand and produce through our brains (Mar 2008). We are insatiable consumers of stories. We find the personal stories of others absolutely compelling, whether as anecdotes or gossip, and spend considerable time engaged with novels, plays, films, and television shows. Our affinity for story emerges at a very young age, when we develop deep and long-lasting emotional attachments to the storybooks and movies that surround us. These fictional stories are not frivolous; stories have the power to change our beliefs about the world, whether or not they &#x201c;really&#x201d; happened. They do &#x201c;really happen&#x201d; in the telling. Readers&#x2019; attitudes shift to become more congruent with the ideas expressed in a narrative after exposure to fiction (Prentice, Gerrig &amp; Bailis 1997; Strange &amp; Leung 1999; Wheeler, Green &amp; Brock 1999). <br> <br>British neuroscientist Mark Turner situates the roots of human mental functioning in story. The way we think is based upon story devices, including metaphor and parable. &#x201c;We organize our experience and our memory of human happenings mainly in the form of narrative.&#x201d; We even create stories to explain the unusual experiences we have in states of psychosis, which then become delusions. We need to understand story, because story is what we use to explain our world. Story is what we use to create identity. Story lies behind our beliefs about the world. <br> <br>There is no single way to understand a story. When we hear a story we look for the many possible beliefs inherent in that story. We find these beliefs by sorting through the beliefs we already have. We are not as concerned with what we are hearing as we are with finding what we already know that is relevant. Picture it this way: We have a list of beliefs, indexed by type of experience and meaning. When a new story appears, we attempt to find a belief that relates to it. When we do, we find a story attached to that belief and compare the story in memory to the one being processed. Our understanding of the new story is a function of the old story. Once we find a belief and connected story, we need do no further processing; the search for other beliefs is co-opted. We rarely look to understand a story in more than one way. The mind does not easily pursue multiple paths. <br><i> <br><b>Telling Stories Back Implies Understanding</b></i> <br> <br>We tell stories for many reasons, one of which is to indicate to our listener that we have understood what we have heard. Our only choice for assessing how well we have been understood as storytellers may be to compare the story that occurs in response to the story we told. <br> <br>We are always looking for stories to tell back to show that we have understood. When we find them, processing stops, and we wait to tell our story. We only incorporate what we have heard into memory when we feel that our own stories are inadequate in some way, for example, if our story is missing a piece. Such pieces can be supplied by other people&#x2019;s stories. We may find a story inadequate when we use it to exemplify a belief that we are not quite sure we hold. We are willing to consider new stories as evidence for or against those beliefs and, therefore, to record and to remember better the stories of others. <br><b> <br><i>The Paradox of Understanding</i></b> <br> <br>The odd paradox to all this is that we are less likely to learn directly from someone else&#x2019;s story than we are to modify our own memories to incorporate aspects of those stories we are hearing. When we hear a story, we are reminded of our own similar stories. The story we heard is recalled in terms of the story of which we were reminded. Thus, we rarely recall the stories of others easily. Generally, other people&#x2019;s stories don&#x2019;t have the richness of detail and emotional impact that allows them to be stored in multiple ways in our memories. They do, however, provide enough details and emotions to allow them to be more easily stored than if the teller had simply told us his belief.</p><h2>Coriolanus (Arden Shakespeare: Second Series)</h2><p><b>Philip Brockbank</b> was Director of the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham in England&nbsp;from 1979-1988, and&nbsp;General Editor of the New Cambridge Shakespeare from 1984-1990.&nbsp; He wrote&nbsp;<i>On Shakespeare: Jesus, Shakespeare and Karl Marx, and Other Essays </i>and edited <i>Players of Shakespeare 1: Essays in Shakespearean Performance</i>.&nbsp; His other publications include <i>The Creativity of Perception: Essays in the Genesis of Literature and Art</i> and <i>Urban Mysteries of the Renaissance: Shakespeare and Carpaccio</i>. The Arden Shakespeare edition of <i>Coriolanus</i> includes a detailed introduction to the text of the play, including the original printing, language and grammar, lineation, act and scene structure, stage-directions, and anomalies of the text, some of which are thought to indicate editorial intervention in the printing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further analysis&nbsp;of the play's content&nbsp;covers the accepted date of composition and historical context for that time, sources, a discussion of tragedy, language, and a description of the play as it was produced on Shakespeare's stage and has been produced in the theater in its afterlife.&nbsp; Two appendices follow <i>The Tragedy of Coriolanus</i>: "The Life of Caius Martius Coriolanus" from Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>,&nbsp;and an extract from Camden's <i>Remaines</i>.&nbsp;<b>The Arden Shakespeare</b> has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume.

Emphasizing <i>hands-on</i> contact with the music--through playing, singing, listening, and analyzing--it provides six chapters on theory, each illustrated with musical examples and fully worked-out analyses, all drawn largely from the "classical" pre-war repertoire by Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartok, Berg, and Webern. Considers three principal kinds of post-tonal music--free atonal music, twelve-tone music, and centric music. Makes extensive use of transformational graphs and networks to present analytical information; and includes a variety of exercises in theory, analysis, musicianship and ear-training, and composition. For anyone interested in Twentieth-Century Music Techniques and Post-Tonal Theory and Analysis.</p><p>A discussion of atonal, twelve-tone, and centric music.<p> Designed for a course in twenty-first-century techniques and analysis, this text offers a clear, comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts of post-tonal theory. Each concept is clearly explained and richly illustrated with examples from the musical literature. The text contains model analyses as well as carefully graduated exercises that involve playing, singing, composing, and analyzing. </p> <p> The third edition stays abreast of recent theoretical developments by including discussions of transformational networks and graphs, contour theory, atonal voice leading, triadic post-tonality (including neotonality), inversional symmetry, and interval cycles. As a result, this text is not only a primer of basic concepts but also an introduction to the current state of post-tonal theory, with its rich array of theoretical concepts and analytical tools. </p> <p> The third edition also features a wide range of composers and musical styles. Although the "classical" prewar repertoire of music by Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartok, Webern, and Berg still comprises the musical core, theoretical concepts are now also illustrated with music by Adams, Babbitt, Berio, Boulez, Britten, Cage, Carter, Cowell, Crawford, Crumb, Debussy, Feldman, Glass, Gubaidulina, Ives, Ligeti, Messiaen, Musgrave, Reich, Ruggles, Sessions, Shostakovich, Stockhausen, Varese, Wolpe, Wuorinen, and Zwillich. </p></p><h2>My Antonia</h2><p>This story of a Bohemian girl in a Nebraska town depicts life in a desolate area and the adaptation of immigrants to American life</p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

The narrative opens with Odysseus hunting wild boar on Ithaca, and continues with his exploits in the Trojan War, and the perils of his fantastic voyage home.<br> Stunningly illustrated, the story is interspersed with a wealth of historical information about the world in which it is supposed the Trojan Wars took place. There are maps, photographs, and detailed reconstructions of places and buildings in the text, such as Old Nestor's palace at Pylos, and of course the city of Troy itself. Also presented is a wealth of archaeological evidence of the everyday life of the period: costume, domestic practices, religious rites, shipbuilding and armour-making.</p><p>Grade 5 Up Remaining faithful to the stories set down by Homer, Connolly takes readers through the life and adventures of Odysseus in straight narrative prose. While the major exploits of such heroes as Achilles are told with relish, they are seen from a viewpoint which holds Odysseus central throughout. The text is accessible to curious ten year olds while remaining interesting enough for older readers. The chapters, illustrated with paintings that Connolly says are based on the most current information available on dress, armor, and weapon styles, are interspersed with inviting factual sections. Here, short informational paragraphs are balanced with maps, photographs, Mycenaean-era sculpture and paintings, palace reconstructions, numerous artifacts, and more. With these as evidence, Connolly attempts to answer questions about the type of helmets the Greek soldiers wore; where Scylla and Charybdis were; and if there really was a Trojan War. This book should prove quite satisfactory to history and mythology buffs. Sally T. Margolis, The Newport Schools, Kensington, Md.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hector's gory end at Achilles' hands, bloody battle scenes, bare-breasted goddesses: readers will find in the paintings of this illustrated work an era they have heard of but may not understandthe days when the Greek gods walked the earth. The battle of Troy is at the forefront of this legend, of course, and Connolly crams in historical data (including maps, drawings of battle scenes and sites, photos or illustrations of genuine artifacts of battle) as well as mythology and speculation, resulting in a well-rounded attempt to explain the lives of men and women of the ancient cities. Whether to pique the interest of readers who have not yet heard of Odysseus, The Iliad or Homer, or to appease those who may have read watered-down versions, this robust work is richly gratifying for one and all.

An intelligent and enquiring child, she is always attentive to the way of life around her &#x2013; the lives of a farming community and nature as it transforms through the seasons, their working lives together and their celebrations. Whilst much is to be admired and cherished about her community, when she looks back on it as an adult she doesn&#x2019;t shy away from describing hardship too. Laura attends the village school and leaves at the age of fourteen to work for the postmistress of the village of Candleford. There her eyes are opened to wider horizons.</p></p><p>Flora Thompson was born in 1876 in Juniper Hill in Oxfordshire, the rural hamlet that she describes in <i>Lark Rise</i>. She was a bookish child who dreamt of being a writer. Her mother taught her to read before she started at the village school. She left school at fourteen to work as an assistant postmistress. She married in 1903 and moved to Bournemouth where she started writing her famous trilogy in her 60s. The three books were published between 1939 and 1943. Thompson died in 1947.</p><h2>Civic Fusion: Mediating Polarized Public Disputes</h2><p>Civic fusion occurs when people bond to achieve a common public goal, even as they sustain deep value differences. This book offers proven strategies for moving polarized parties to consensus solutions based on the author's 25 years of mediation and negotiation experience, including working with pro-life and pro-choice leaders after fatal shootings at women's health clinics, crane industry and union representatives to develop federal worker safety regulations, and citizens of a failed city that reclaimed their democracy by writing a consensus charter.<br><br>Using these and other real-world examples, Civic Fusion guides readers through a provocative discussion about what mediators aspire to do, what they actually do, and what needs to be done to bring disparate groups of people together to reach agreements on complicated public policy questions. It provides innovative strategies for productive multi-party, multi-issue negotiations.<br></p><p>Susan L. Podziba has been a Public Policy Mediator for twenty-five years.

Michael Dawson demonstrates, however, that the growth of a black middle class has left race as the dominant influence on African- American politics. Why have African Americans remained so united in most of their political attitudes? To account for this phenomenon, Dawson develops a new theory of group interests that emphasizes perceptions of "linked fates" and black economic subordination.</p></p><p><p>"Scholarship, in disciplines and subfields, significantly changes, when mature, inventive, and brilliant works emerge. This book is one such moment and event. It is a pioneering and painstaking exploration of African-American politics from the standpoint of the people in that community, using their opinions, attitudes, and behaviors as guides."--<b>Hanes Walton, Jr., University of Michigan</b></p> <p>"Until now, no one has fully probed the contours of black group identity or looked systematically at the tension between solidarity and class differences among African Americans. Michael Dawson has done just that. He combines the best survey, a deep sense of historical and social context, and a vivid realization of why politics matters to show us how much African Americans remain unified, where they are dividing, and how racial group interests deeply affect all Americans."--<b>Jennifer Hochschild, Harvard University</b></p><b>Michael C.

A child narrator states, "Boodil is a bullterrier. She's the best dog in the whole world. Her brilliant mind is always at work. Her guard is never down." The text then continues to support this introduction with examples of her bravery, her strength, her alertness for danger and burglars, her intelligence and independence. The deadpan humor is cleverly integrated through the watercolor line drawings. Done in tones of brown and gray, they reveal the "real" Boodil as well as the child's perception of the pet. "I bet only Boodil's amazing superdog self-control keeps her from ripping the vacuum to pieces." Readers see in the illustration the large, white animal cowering under the sofa as the vacuum is pushed in her direction. Lindenbaum has created a lovable, huggable character much like Rylant's Mudge (Bradbury). Boodil is one lucky dog to have such a faithful, protective owner and libraries will b fortunate to have this addition to their picture-book collections. --Cheryl Cufari, N. A. Walbran Elem . School, Oriskany, NY<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Doting pet owners relentlessly accentuate the positive about their charges, as this winsomely silly portrait reminds us. Paunchy, beady-eyed, loafing Boodil (a bull terrier) hardly seems an intrepid or sophisticated creature, yet each spread here features an unseen narrator's effusive praise of the dog's virtues. When Boodil plops down on a rock at the park, her owner gushes, "She looks like a royal statue . . . I'm so proud of her." Later, Boodil hides from the vacuum cleaner and, in a peppy mood, vaults the coffee table "like an amazing white cannonball." Swedish author Lindenbaum ( Elsa-Marie and Her Seven Little Daddies ) offers comical black-and-white renderings of a less-than-graceful canine; she uses gray background details and sparingly applies splashes of color--on Boodil's pink nose, for example. A chunky, bold typeface lends the pages a fresh, somewhat unusual appearance. Lindenbaum and translator Charbonnet, in this absurd yet affectionate juxtaposition of images and hyperbolic text, capture the unconditional love for man's best friend.
